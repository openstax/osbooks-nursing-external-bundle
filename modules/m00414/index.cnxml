  <title>Insulin</title>
  <para id="para-00002">Insulin is released by ß cells from the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas after eating a meal. The carbohydrates from the meal are broken down into glucose. As glucose enters the bloodstream, insulin is secreted and allows the cells in muscles, fat, and the liver to absorb the glucose for energy (American Diabetes Association, n.d.-d). Insulin not only is important for glucose homeostasis, but it also plays a role in lipid metabolism through lipolysis and assists in protein metabolism through downregulation of hepatic and muscle enzymes, and its action within endothelial cells and macrophages has an anti-inflammatory effect on the body. </para>
  <para id="para-00003">Insulin has three characteristics: onset, peak, and duration. Onset is the length of time before insulin reaches the bloodstream and begins to lower glucose levels. Peak time is discussed below. Duration is how long insulin continues to lower blood glucose levels. </para>
  <section id="sect-00003">
  <title>Peak Time</title>
  <para id="para-00004"><term id="term-00001">Peak time</term> is when insulin is at its maximum strength in terms of lowering blood glucose levels. Individuals are at a higher risk of developing hypoglycemia symptoms when insulin is peaking (American Diabetes Association, n.d.-d).</para>

  <title>Administration of Insulin</title>
  <para id="para-00014">Insulin typically comes as an injectable source because it needs to bypass the first pass of digestion for absorbtion due to its instability in the presence of gastric acid. Insulin is injected into the <term id="term-00007">subcutaneous</term> tissue via an insulin syringe, insulin pen, or insulin pump. Injection sites for insulin are located primarily on the abdomen, back of the upper arm, lower back, buttocks, and upper outer thigh (see <link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00414"/>). The rate of absorption depends on the injection site. Insulin injection sites should be rotated to prevent fatty deposits and site irritation (American Diabetes Association, n.d.-d).</para>

  <title>Methods of Insulin Dosing</title>
  <para id="para-00015">Most insulin is given on a carbohydrate-to-insulin ratio via a fixed-dose insulin method with an insulin syringe (American Diabetes Association, n.d.-d). Fixed-dose therapy can apply to clients who take one injection a day and to clients taking multiple injections per day. With fixed-dose insulin therapy, a client will take the same amount of insulin at a specific time each day; for example, take 30 units of insulin at breakfast each day and 20 units at dinner each day. Because the doses stay the same from one day to another, the client will need to eat a specific amount of carbohydrates for each meal (Diabetes.co.uk, 2023).</para>
  <para id="para-00016">In health care settings such as a hospital or a nursing home, insulin may also be administered via a <term id="term-00008">sliding scale coverage</term> method. The sliding scale method typically uses a short-acting insulin (Migdal et al., 2021). The dose of insulin is based on the blood glucose level just before a meal, which is taken using a glucometer. </para>
  <para id="para-00017">Although still commonly used in health care settings, sliding scale insulin has become controversial in recent years because it has not been shown to control blood glucose levels very well. Sliding scale insulin dosing not only has demonstrated poor blood glucose control, but also does not reflect a person’s current insulin needs based on their diet, weight, and insulin history. Currently, it is recommended that <term id="term-00009">basal insulin dosing</term> be used instead of sliding scale for glycemic control. With basal dosing, a long-acting insulin is administered to keep insulin levels steady throughout the day, and then a rapid-acting insulin is administered during mealtimes to regulate spikes in blood glucose levels after meals (Migdal et al., 2021).</para>
  <section id="sect-00012">
  <title>Insulin Pen</title>
  <para id="para-00018">An <term id="term-00010">insulin pen</term> is a pen-shaped injector device that combines insulin and a syringe in one unit. Insulin pens are prefilled with an insulin cartridge or have a prefilled insulin reservoir. The pens have a dial, and disposable needles can be attached to the pen. Insulin pens are relatively easy to use and convenient. To use an insulin pen, the client should twist on a needle, dial the dose as prescribed by the health care provider, and inject into the subcutaneous site. The needle is then thrown away into a sharps container, and the pen is placed in a safe area until the next dose of insulin is due (American Diabetes Association, n.d.-d).</para>
  <para id="para-00019">Pens are disposable after all of the insulin in the pen has been used or the pen has expired. Pens are often color-coded to make it easier to recognize the type of insulin the pen contains. Pens are portable and can be used discreetly in public places when needed (American Diabetes Association, n.d.-d).</para>
  <note class="clinical-tip" id="note-00002">
  <title>Insulin Pens</title>
  <para id="para-00021">Insulin pens should never be used for more than one person or for someone other than the person they were prescribed for. Regurgitation of blood into the insulin cartridge or reservoir can occur after injection. The risk of blood-borne pathogen transmission increases if the insulin pen is used on more than one person (CDC, 2022a).</para>

  <title>Insulin Pump and Continuous Glucose Monitoring</title>
  <para id="para-00022">An <term id="term-00011">insulin pump</term> is a small, computerized infusion set device that delivers insulin. Doses of a rapid-acting insulin are supplied through a flexible catheter that has been inserted through the skin into the subcutaneous tissue. Insulin pumps are often integrated with a <term id="term-00012">continuous glucose monitor (CGM)</term>, which is a device that monitors blood glucose levels on a continual basis. CGMs decrease the need for finger sticks and blood sampling with a glucometer. CGMs are applied to the back of the arm, abdomen, or upper gluteal areas and covered with a bandage. These devices need to be changed every 10–14 days. CGMs are accompanied by an app that synchronizes with the sensor in the device. This allows for easy and portable blood glucose tracking. Insulin pumps and CGMs have been successfully utilized across all age groups (American Diabetes Association, n.d.-d).</para>
  <para id="para-00023">Insulin pumps are set to deliver a small dose of insulin continuously. This is called a basal dose insulin, and it mimics the body’s normal release of insulin. The basal dose insulin is calculated and programmed by the health care provider based on the client’s glycemic needs. A <term id="term-00013">bolus</term> dose insulin may also be delivered by the insulin pump close to mealtimes to control the rise in blood glucose levels after a meal (American Diabetes Association, n.d.-d).</para>

  <title>Intravenous Insulin</title>
  <para id="para-00025"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">Intravenous insulin</term> is administered by a health care professional to a client in a health care setting. Insulin is administered directly into the bloodstream via an intravenous catheter. Intravenous insulin is used to treat hyperglycemic emergencies and other conditions such as diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar (extremely high glucose) states, and hyperkalemia. Human regular insulin is typically the only insulin given intravenously; however, according to Rubin, Khanna, and McIver (2022), insulin aspart, a rapid-acting insulin, may be administered through a subcutaneous infusion via pump or intravenously as a diluted solution with close monitoring of blood glucose and serum potassium levels. Once the insulin is injected into the intravenous catheter, it only takes a few minutes for it to enter the bloodstream and to start working to lower blood glucose levels. Intravenous insulin therapy is typically administered short term for a period of 3–12 hours and requires close monitoring by a health care professional (Thota &amp; Akbar, 2022).</para>
  <para id="para-00026">Intravenous insulin can be administered via a bolus dose method and/or as a <term id="term-00015">titrated</term> insulin drip requiring an infusion device. A bolus dose of insulin is administered via the intravenous line when rapid reduction of blood glucose levels is needed, such as with a severe hyperglycemic state like diabetic ketoacidosis (Dhatariya et al., 2020). </para>
  <para id="para-00027">A titrated intravenous insulin drip, also called an insulin infusion, may be required to assist with reducing severely elevated blood glucose levels when a bolus dose of intravenous insulin alone does not assist in reaching the targeted blood glucose level for the client. Titrated insulin drips provide 1 unit of a rapid-acting or short-acting insulin per milliliter of 0.9% sodium chloride. The titrated insulin drips are typically started at 1 unit/hour and titrated based on the facility’s protocol in association with the client’s blood glucose level. For example, if the client’s blood glucose level is 111–140 mg/dL, the titrated insulin drip is set to infuse at 1 unit/hour; if the client’s blood glucose level is 141–175 mg/dL, the titrated insulin drip is set to infuse at 2 units/hour. Blood glucose levels are checked hourly, and the insulin infusion is titrated based on the blood glucose levels until the client reaches glucose homeostasis. Once the client has reached glucose homeostasis, subcutaneous insulin is administered, and the client is weaned off of the titrated insulin drip (Dhatariya et al., 2020). </para>
  <note class="clinical-tip" id="note-00004">
  <title>Titrate Insulin Drip to Subcutaneous Insulin</title>
  <para id="para-00029">The nurse or health care provider should check blood glucose levels 1 hour prior to discontinuing the titrated insulin drip. The first dose of subcutaneous insulin should be administered prior to discontinuing the titrated insulin drip. The titrated insulin drip should be continued for 30–60 minutes after the subcutaneous insulin injection to prevent rebound hyperglycemia (Dhatariya et al., 2020). </para>

  <title>Adverse Effects and Contraindications</title>
  <para id="para-00030">Insulin is a natural hormone present in the body. In clients with diabetes, insulin use as a medication is generally safe and effective; however, there can be certain adverse effects and contraindications associated with its use.</para>
  <para id="para-00031">Typical adverse effects of all types of insulin include hypoglycemia (symptoms include shakiness, dizziness, sweating, confusion, and, in severe cases, loss of consciousness), weight gain (due to an increased glucose uptake and storage in cells), injection site reactions (such as redness, swelling, or itching), lipodystrophy (fat tissue changes from repeated use of the same injection site), and fluid retention (swelling in the legs and feet).</para>
  <para id="para-00032">Contraindications include hypersensitivity to the components in the insulin, especially animal-derived insulins. Caution should be used in clients with medical conditions that cause fluid retention, such as heart failure and renal failure (as insulin can cause additional fluid retention leading to volume overload), and in clients with liver failure (as insulin is metabolized by the liver).</para>
