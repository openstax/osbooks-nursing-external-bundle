<title>Interferons</title>
<para id="para-00002"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">Interferons</term> are proteins that are released in response to pathogens. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">Synthetic interferons</term> have been made to resemble naturally occurring ones. These agents are important for treating viral infections, neoplasms, and autoimmune diseases such as MS. They have antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory actions and should be used early in the disease because they have been shown to modify disease progression and reduce relapse rates. Interferon drugs are available as interferon beta-1a (given intramuscularly) and interferon beta-1b (given subcutaneously). This classification reduces the severity of symptoms and decreases the number of lesions detected with MRI. There are different mechanisms of action for interferons, including inhibition of the growth of some cells, changes in cell surface antigen expression, and induction to lymphocytic cytotoxicity.</para>

<title>Adverse Effects and Contraindications</title>
<para id="para-00004">Avonex is produced by recombinant DNA technology using genetically engineered Chinese hamster ovary cells into which the human interferon beta gene has been introduced. Betaseron is manufactured by bacterial fermentation of a strain of <emphasis effect="italics">Escherichia coli</emphasis> that possesses the gene for human interferon beta. In addition, the medication contains mannitol and albumin. Anyone with a hypersensitivity to any of these three components could develop angioedema or anaphylaxis (DailyMed, <emphasis effect="italics">Betaseron</emphasis>, 2023).</para>
<para id="para-00005">Flu-like symptoms on treatment days are common when first started. Symptoms experienced are fever, chills, myalgia, malaise, and sweating. These usually diminish over time. The symptoms can be minimized by starting with a low dose and then slowly titrating up to the full dose or by giving an analgesic/antipyretic medication before taking the interferon. Neutralizing antibodies can form against synthetic agents. This will decrease the drug’s effectiveness but also increase the risk of anaphylaxis.</para>
<para id="para-00006">Drug-induced lupus erythematous has been reported. Clinical manifestations include rash, polyarthritis, nephritis, and serositis. If this occurs, the drug should be stopped. Interferon beta can injure the liver by causing an asymptomatic increase in circulating liver enzymes. Liver function tests must be monitored routinely. If liver injury is evident, the dose can be decreased or a temporary interruption of treatment could be tried. When the liver function returns to baseline, treatment can resume with continued careful monitoring (DailyMed, <emphasis effect="italics">Betaseron</emphasis>, 2023).</para>
<para id="para-00007">Transient injection site reactions include redness, pain, swelling, itching, or a lump. Injection site necrosis can occur with this drug, and some lesions have extended to the fascia overlying the muscle. Some have developed injection site abscesses and cellulitis, but this is usually the result of poor technique.</para>
<para id="para-00008">With interferon alpha, clients can develop subclinical hypothyroidism. It first causes inflammation of the thyroid (thyroiditis) that causes a short period of hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism. Symptoms of heart failure can be exacerbated. Although these drugs have no direct-acting cardiac toxicity properties, they can trigger symptoms to arise.</para>
<para id="para-00009">Other immunosuppressive agents may increase the toxic effects of both immunosuppressives and elevate the risk of serious infection. Infections are related to the immunosuppressant effects. Many of these are opportunistic and are produced by microbes that do not normally cause infections unless the host is immunocompromised. Live vaccines should be avoided due to increased risk of vaccine-related infections. If needed, clients should receive them at least 4–6 weeks before starting therapy, especially the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccine if one did not have chickenpox. Overall, the immunosuppression decreases the body’s response to vaccines and renders them useless (DailyMed, <emphasis effect="italics">Betaseron</emphasis>, 2023).</para>

<title>Immunomodulators</title>
<para id="para-00014"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">Immunomodulators</term> work by blocking the activity of specific cytokines, which promote autoimmune reactions and inflammation in MS. Immunomodulators are used for treating relapsing forms of MS (RRMS and active SPMS) and reducing the frequency of relapses and slowing down the accumulation of disabilities. The following are some common immunomodulators:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00005">
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Teriflunomide:</emphasis> An active metabolite of leflunomide, which is a drug that was previously approved to treat rheumatic arthritis. It inhibits dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. The overall result is a reduction of the number of activated lymphocytes in the CNS. This can reduce or prevent the number of relapses a client experiences (DailyMed, <emphasis effect="italics">Teriflunomide</emphasis>, 2023).</item>
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Monomethyl fumarate:</emphasis> This drug inhibits immune processes that damage the brain and spinal cord; it also has antioxidant properties. Monomethyl fumarate comes in a delayed-release capsule. Certain lab tests must be obtained before initiating this drug, including CBC with differential, liver enzymes, and total bilirubin levels. A CBC with differential also needs to be obtained 6 months after the start of the medication and then every 6–12 months thereafter. Adverse reactions associated with this drug include flushing, anaphylaxis, angioedema, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), herpes zoster, lymphopenia, and hepatotoxicity. A non-enteric coated aspirin (325 mg or less) may be taken 30 minutes before taking the drug to reduce the incidence or severity of flushing. For the remaining adverse reactions, the drug is held and appropriate treatment given (DailyMed, <emphasis effect="italics">Bafiertam</emphasis>, 2023).</item>
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Glatiramer acetate:</emphasis> This drug is thought to curb the body’s attack of the myelin covering by acting as a decoy to T-cell attack. Also, it induces and activates suppressor T cells in the periphery, which modifies the immune process. This drug does not cause many of the bone suppression reactions or flu-like symptoms similar to the other immunomodulators. It can cause postinjection reactions including flushing, urticaria, chest tightness, palpitations, or dyspnea. These should last only a few minutes and subside spontaneously. If symptoms last longer or are more intense, the client must notify the provider immediately (DailyMed,<emphasis effect="italics"> Glatiramer Acetate</emphasis>, 2023).</item>
</list>
<para id="para-00015">The medication must be stored in the refrigerator. Before administration, allow the medication to stand at room temperature for 20 minutes. Syringes are single-use only—any unused portion must be discarded. Injection is subcutaneously in the arms, abdomen, hips, or thighs. Injection sites should be rotated to prevent <term id="term-00008">lipoatrophy</term> (localized loss of fat tissue). Clients who have hypersensitivity to mannitol should avoid this drug because mannitol is part of the drug mixture.</para>

<title>Adverse Effects and Contraindications</title>
<para id="para-00017">Teriflunomide is very hepatoxic throughout therapy. If the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) amount is three times the upper normal limit on two consecutive tests, the drug must be immediately stopped, and an accelerated elimination procedure will begin. This procedure includes the administration of cholestyramine or activated charcoal for 11 days. In addition, this drug is highly teratogenic, and a negative pregnancy test must be obtained before therapy. The client should avoid pregnancy and speak with their provider if they are planning on becoming pregnant. Teriflunomide is eliminated very slowly and can take months to be fully leave the body.</para>
<para id="para-00018">Clients should be screened for latent tuberculosis (TB) before beginning therapy with immunomodulators because they have been found to activate latent TB, causing an active TB infection to develop. If found to be positive, the client must be treated for the active TB before initiating immunomodulators.</para>
<para id="para-00019">This group of drugs can cause peripheral neuropathy—either mononeuropathy or polyneuropathy. Risk factors include being <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">older than 60 years of age</term>, concurrent neurotoxic medications, and diabetes. Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome has been associated with the use of this drug and is characterized by multiorgan hypersensitivity. DRESS can include symptoms like fever, rash, enlarged lymph nodes, facial swelling, hepatitis, nephritis, myocarditis, or myositis. Blood pressure should be checked before therapy and periodically throughout. An elevated blood pressure should be properly managed.</para>
<para id="para-00020">Concurrent use of drugs that have immunosuppressive and/or bone marrow suppressive properties should be avoided because it can increase the risk of infections. Teriflunomide can decrease the peak international normalized ratio (INR) by 25% in clients taking warfarin. Close monitoring of the INR is warranted to evaluate for warfarin dose adjustments to maintain therapeutic levels. This drug can also reduce the effectiveness of some oral contraceptives; therefore, a second barrier backup plan should be in place. In addition, the HMG-Co-A reductase inhibitors are prevented from being metabolized and can build up in the body. Live vaccines should be avoided because they can increase the risk of infection. These vaccines should be held until 6 months after immunomodulators have been discontinued.</para>

<title>Monoclonal Antibodies</title>
<para id="para-00027"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">Monoclonal antibodies</term> are derived from a single B-cell source. Cloning of individual B lymphocytes results in the production of biologically identical antibody molecules. These drugs must be administered intravenously because they are proteins and would get destroyed in the GI system if taken orally. A mouse or hamster is injected with the human antigen for the rodent to produce the desired antibody. Once the antigen is administered, the rodent’s immune system mounts a response. Its B lymphocytes are stimulated to produce a specific antibody against that particular antigen. The B lymphocytes are extracted from the animal’s spleen. The antibodies can then be isolated and prepared for clinical use. Because these antibodies originate from one single cell line, it is possible to design them to suppress specific components of the immune system responsible for causing tissue damage in certain conditions. The generic names of the monoclonal antibodies end in “-mab.”</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00009">
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Alemtuzumab:</emphasis> This agent is generally reserved for people who have had inadequate responses to two or more MS therapies. Due to its safety profile, this drug is only available through a restricted distribution program. Prescribers must be certified with the program by completing training. Clients must enroll and comply with ongoing monitoring requirements, and pharmacies must be authorized to dispense to certified facilities (DailyMed, <emphasis effect="italics">Lemtrada</emphasis>, 2023).</item>
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Ocrelizumab:</emphasis> This agent is indicated as a monotherapy for treating relapsing forms of MS including CIS, RRMS, and SSMS. In contrast to alemtuzumab and natalizumab, this medication is also used in the treatment of PPMS. This drug is administered via IV infusion and targets circulating CD20 markers on B lymphocytes, which produce antibodies. Clients must be premedicated with steroids and an antihistamine before each infusion to reduce infusion-related reactions. They also must be monitored during and for at least 1 hour after infusion; however, clients must be aware that reactions can occur up to 24 hours after the dose was received (DailyMed, <emphasis effect="italics">Ocrevus</emphasis>, 2023).</item>
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Natalizumab:</emphasis> This drug is indicated as a monotherapy for treating relapsing forms of MS including CIS, RRMS, and SSMS. This drug prevents cells of the immune system from entering the brain and spinal cord. It is very effective but is mainly used in clients who have failed first-line therapies. Only prescribers registered in the MS TOUCH Prescribing Program may prescribe this drug. Clients must read the medication guide and sign the enrollment form. The mechanism of action for natalizumab is different and complex compared with alemtuzumab. Overall, this drug demonstrates reduction of leukocyte migration into the brain and reduction of plaque formation. This results in an increase of the number of circulating leukocytes. The drug does not affect the absolute neutrophil count (DailyMed, <emphasis effect="italics">Tysabri</emphasis>, 2023).</item>

<title>Adverse Effects and Contraindications</title>
<para id="para-00029">Alemtuzumab must be administered in a certified health care setting with appropriate equipment to manage anaphylaxis or other serious infusion reactions, such as myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ischemic/hemorrhagic stroke, and cervicocephalic arterial dissection. These can occur following any of the doses being given. To reduce infusion-related adverse effects, clients should be premedicated with high-dose corticosteroids for the first three days of each treatment course. They can also receive antihistamines and/or antipyretics before the dose. Additionally, antiviral agents should be administered for herpetic prophylaxis starting on the first day of dosing and continue for a minimum of 2 months after completion of alemtuzumab dosing or until the CD4+ lymphocyte count is less than 200 cells/microliter.</para>
<para id="para-00030">Some autoimmune disorders caused by alemtuzumab include immune thrombocytopenia (spontaneous bleeding, petechiae, heavy menstrual bleeding, hemoptysis), glomerular nephropathies (edema, decreased urine output, hematuria), autoimmune hemolytic anemia (chest pain, jaundice, dark urine, tachycardia), and thyroiditis.</para>
<para id="para-00031">Clients of child-bearing age should consistently use effective contraception during therapy and for 4 months after a course of treatment. This drug can cause fetal harm.</para>
<para id="para-00032">A few infections caused by alemtuzumab include hepatitis, human papilloma virus (HPV), TB, and fungal infections, especially oral and vaginal candidiasis. Any client with active disease of these infections should not take the monoclonal antibodies. Pregnant or breastfeeding clients should avoid monoclonal antibodies.</para>
<para id="para-00033">The FDA recommends that 6 weeks before starting therapy, clients should be vaccinated for VZV. No live-virus vaccines should be received after starting monoclonal antibodies.</para>

<title>Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor Modulators</title>
<para id="para-00042"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00023">Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators</term> regulate immune activity by specifically blocking the activity of S1P receptors found on the surface of lymphocytes. This prevents the lymphocytes from leaving the lymph nodes and entering the bloodstream, thus reducing their activity in the CNS. S1P receptor modulators are oral drugs prescribed for RRMS and active SPMS. There are currently three drugs on the market that fit into this category. This chapter will only focus on <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">siponimod fumaric acid</term> (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00025">Mayzent</term>) because there are very few differences among them. The drug is associated with a CYP2C9 genotype variant that alters the dose.</para>
<section id="sect-00013">
<title>Adverse Effects and Contraindications</title>
<para id="para-00043">Initiation of S1P drug therapy results in a decrease in heart rate, for which monitoring is recommended. The nurse should administer the first dose in a setting in which resources to appropriately manage symptomatic bradycardia are available. Before dosing and at the end of the observation period, an ECG should be obtained for all clients. Observation of clients overnight is necessary if they are at higher risk of symptomatic bradycardia, heart block, prolonged QTc interval, or if taking drugs with known risk of torsades de pointes. If post-dose symptomatic bradycardia occurs, appropriate management should be initiated, beginning with continuous ECG monitoring and continuing until the symptoms have resolved.</para>
<para id="para-00044">Another adverse effect is macular edema. Fundoscopic examinations are essential before and 3–4 months after the treatment has been started. They are also performed again whenever a client reports visual disturbances. Diabetes mellitus and uveitis increase the risk of macular edema.</para>
<para id="para-00045">S1P receptor modulators may also cause fetal harm. Advise clients of child-bearing age of the potential risk to a fetus and to use an effective method of contraception during treatment and for 10 days after stopping the drug.</para>
<para id="para-00046">Furthermore, siponimod fumaric acid can cause an increase in blood pressure readings. Blood pressure should be monitored routinely, and any significant changes should be reported to the provider. Suspicious skin lesions should be evaluated because the risk of basal cell carcinoma and melanoma is increased in clients being treated with siponimod fumaric acid.</para>
<para id="para-00047">There have been reported cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) in clients receiving an S1P receptor modulator. This is caused by swelling and narrowing of the blood vessels within the brain. If a client complains of a sudden onset of a severe headache, altered mental status, vision changes, or seizure activity, the provider should promptly schedule a complete physical and neurological examination and consider an MRI. Symptoms are usually reversible but may evolve into ischemic stroke or cerebral hemorrhage. Delay in diagnosis and treatment may lead to permanent neurological sequelae. If PRES is suspected, the drug should be discontinued.</para>
<para id="para-00048">Before initiation of treatment with siponimod fumaric acid, clients should be tested to determine their CYP2C9 genotype. Substantially elevated siponimod plasma levels may occur in clients who are homozygous for CYP2C9*3, so its use is contraindicated in these individuals.</para>
<para id="para-00049">This therapy can cause a dose-dependent reduction in peripheral lymphocyte count to 20%–30% of baseline values because of reversible sequestration of lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues. It is important not to start therapy in clients with active infection.</para>
<para id="para-00050">Avoid live vaccines during therapy and for 4 weeks after to prevent the possibility of developing an infection. Concurrently taking antineoplastics or immunosuppressive or immune-modulating therapies can elevate the client’s risk of infection. Class Ia or Class III antiarrhythmic drugs should be avoided due to the increased risk of prolongation of the QTc interval. The administration of drugs that slow the heart rate or decrease atrioventricular conduction (e.g., beta blockers, digoxin, diltiazem, or verapamil) can intensify the risk of dysrhythmias or atrioventricular block or can exacerbate manifestations of heart failure. Monitor for the development of severe increase in disability following drug discontinuation and begin appropriate treatment as needed.</para>

<title>Muscle Relaxants</title>
<para id="para-00055">Muscle spasticity is the result of damage to neurons within the CNS rather than injury to the peripheral structures. Clients often report stiffness and/or heavy muscles, difficulty with movement, and pain. Because the nerve damage originates in the CNS, the risk of this becoming permanent is high. Spasticity results in the excessive stimulation of muscles (hypertonia) in opposing muscle groups at the same time. The different types and brands of skeletal <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00026">muscle</term> relaxants work in different ways to affect muscle function. Most are CNS depressants and prevent the nerves from sending pain signals to the brain. They have no direct effect on skeletal muscle. Other actions may include the blockage of nerve impulses that cause increased muscle tone and contraction (Cleveland Clinic, 2023).</para>
<section id="sect-00016">
<title>Centrally Acting Muscle Relaxant</title>
<para id="para-00056">Along with treating spasticity, baclofen is helpful in treating pain from trigeminal neuralgia that occurs in MS. This drug is available in oral and intrathecal (within the spine) forms and can be administered through an implantable delivery pump for treating central spasticity. The drug has no direct effect on skeletal muscle; therefore, it does not reduce muscle strength.</para>

<title>Peripherally Acting Muscle Relaxant</title>
<para id="para-00057">Dantrolene acts peripherally on the muscle itself. The drug inhibits the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum directly within skeletal muscle cells.

This drug is also used in the treatment and prevention of malignant hyperthermia (manages muscle contraction and rigidity).

<title>Adverse Effects and Contraindications</title>
<para id="para-00059">The most common adverse effects for baclofen are related to CNS depression. Constipation and urinary retention are linked to CNS depression of the parasympathetic nervous system reflexes. This slows down peristalsis and relaxes the detrusor muscle of the bladder. Baclofen crosses the placenta and enters the breast milk, so a fetus/infant may develop CNS depression.</para>
<para id="para-00060">Cardiac concerns, such as heart failure and arrhythmias, result from the depression of the normal reflex arcs. This drug could exacerbate heart failure due to depressed muscle function caused by these drugs.</para>
<para id="para-00061">If the oral version of baclofen is stopped too quickly, this can cause the development of psychoses, visual hallucinations, and seizures. The drug should be tapered off over a 1- to 2-week period. Abrupt withdrawal of the intrathecal route can be more dangerous. Possible reactions include high fever, altered mental status, rebound spasticity, and muscle rigidity that could lead to muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis).</para>
<para id="para-00062">Blocking the spasticity associated with movement, posture, or balance results in loss of these functions. This places clients at high risk for falls.</para>
<para id="para-00063">Some common adverse reactions for dantrolene include diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Clients with respiratory depression must be closely monitored because this can be exacerbated by muscular weakness. Dose-related hepatotoxicity is the most serious adverse effect. Baseline liver enzymes should be obtained and monitored periodically throughout treatment. If clients show no response within 45 days of initiating this drug, it should be stopped to prevent damage to the liver. Caution should be used in all clients older than 35 years of age due to their increased risk of potentially fatal hepatocellular disease. Supplemental estrogen increases the incidence of hepatocellular toxicity. This drug should be discontinued at the first indication of hepatic impairment (DailyMed,<emphasis effect="italics"> Baclofen</emphasis>, 2023).</para>

<para id="para-00070">Seizures may be slightly more common in people with MS due to the way the condition affects the brain. MS damages several parts of the brain, which can lead to disruptions in signal transmission. The scar tissue of an MS lesion creates a barrier to the transmission of nerve signals down a path. The flow of the nerve signals gets redirected. If the lesions create enough barriers, the result is an abnormal discharge of excessive electrical energy from the nerve cells of the brain. Clinical manifestations vary depending on the area of the brain affected.</para>
<para id="para-00071">There are various forms of seizures. Some stimulate motor nerves, whereas others affect autonomic and sensory nerves (Moreo &amp; Benbadis, 2019). The form a particular seizure takes depends on the cell location that initiated the electrical discharge and the neural pathways stimulated by that initial impulse. In general, the three main categories of seizures are generalized, focal, and combined. The combined form is referred to as a focal to bilateral seizure where the impulse initiated in one area of the brain and then spread to both hemispheres (secondary generalized seizure). For a more detailed discussion on the different types of seizures and their treatment, refer to <link document="m00307">Anticonvulsant Drugs and Drugs to Treat Epilepsy, Migraine Headaches, and Intracranial Emergencies</link>.</para>

<title>Adverse Effects and Contraindications</title>
<para id="para-00074">Hypersensitivity reactions have occurred with GABA structural analogs. Angioedema is characterized by swelling of the face, tongue, lips, gums, throat, and larynx. The drug should immediately be discontinued at the first sign of angioedema or other hypersensitivity reaction, such as hives, rash, wheezing, or dyspnea. Weight gain, due to an increased appetite, can be significant; some clients gain 7% or more in a few months. There is a possibility of rhabdomyolysis, so clients should be taught to let the provider know if muscle pain/tenderness occurs. Decreased sperm counts, reduced sperm motility, and increased sperm abnormalities can occur in men taking the drug. Clients may develop a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia).</para>
<para id="para-00075">Also, it has been reported pregabalin causes subjective effects similar to diazepam, increasing the risk of physical dependence. To avoid withdrawal symptoms, such as headache, diarrhea, or insomnia, the drug should be discontinued over at least 1 week.</para>
<para id="para-00076">CNS depressants and alcohol can increase the depressant effects of pregabalin. Taking angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors concurrently increases the risk of swelling and hives. If taking thiazolidinediones with pregabalin, there is a higher chance of weight gain or swelling of one’s hands or feet.</para>

<section class="chapter-summary" id="sect-00023">
<para id="para-00081">This chapter discussed the disease processes and drug classifications used in managing two progressive neurodegenerative conditions: Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis. There are similarities and differences among these conditions. Both cause motor and autonomic system manifestations, and neither has an identified cure. Both diseases are diagnosed mainly by clinical presentation. Medications are essentially beneficial in reducing symptoms of these conditions. In addition, medications are helpful in preventing relapses in MS and delaying the progression of PD.</para>
<para id="para-00082">The medications for each condition are distinct based on the etiologies. In PD, the medications are focused on increasing dopamine levels in the CNS by using dopamine replacement/dopamine agonist agents. Also, drugs that inhibit enzymes that metabolize the levodopa in the periphery—MAO and COMT inhibitors—are used so more dopamine reaches the CNS. Anticholinergic agents can be used as a second-line therapy in PD to decrease the unopposed ACh levels that cause many symptoms. In contrast, the overall purpose of medication in MS is to alter the immune system components to prevent further attack and damage. Generally, these are considered immunomodulators or have immunosuppressant properties. Drugs such as glucocorticoids or immunoglobulins are used in acute episodes to reduce severity and duration of the relapse. Importantly, varied classifications are necessary to treat nonmotor symptoms, such as spasticity and seizures. Overall, the main outcome for both conditions is for the client to continue to be independent as long as possible.</para>
