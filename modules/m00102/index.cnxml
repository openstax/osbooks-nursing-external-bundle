<title>Forms and Routes of Administration</title>
<para id="para-00003">There are many different <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">forms of medication</term>: liquid, suspensions, tablets, capsules, lotions, and ointment, to name a few. There are also many routes through which medications can be given and absorbed into the body. The routes of medication administration are broadly categorized as follows:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00002">
<item><emphasis effect="italics"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">Enteral drug administration</term>:</emphasis> “Enteral” means “pertaining to the small intestine.” Most enteral medications are absorbed in the intestines. The primary routes for enteral administration are oral and, to a lesser extent, rectal. Some clients have tubes placed directly into the gastrointestinal tract (i.e., nasogastric tubes or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy [PEG] tubes). Absorption will vary, but all will be affected by the first-pass effect.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="italics"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">Parenteral drug administration</term>:</emphasis> “Parenteral” refers to any drug that is administered outside of the GI tract; however, it most commonly refers to injectable drugs administered via the subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intravenous routes. Drugs administered via these routes have improved bioavailability because they bypass the first-pass effect, making absorption and onset of action more rapid.
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00003">
<item><emphasis effect="italics"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">Percutaneous drug administration</term>:</emphasis> Some sources will define percutaneous administration as a separate category or a subcategory of parenteral routes. The percutaneous route refers to topical drugs absorbed through the skin—lotions, ointments, creams, or patches.</item></list></item>

<para id="para-00004">The following sections describe the equipment needed for the administration of medications. The various techniques of each route are detailed, along with their pertinent advantages and disadvantages. Nursing implications are also covered in relation to each route of administration.</para>

<title><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">Medication Safety</term></title>
<para id="para-00005">The following are some tips for medication safety:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00004">
<item>It is best practice to prepare medications for only one client at a time. This safety practice reduces the risk of inadvertently administering medications to the incorrect client.</item>
<item>Medications that require a focused assessment or monitoring should be kept separate from other medications. For example, if administering a medication that lowers blood pressure and heart rate, vital signs should be assessed before giving the drug. Because opioids may cause respiratory depression, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation should be assessed before and after administration of the drug.</item>
<item>All unit-dose medications should be opened at the bedside rather than in the medication room.</item>
<item>Never leave medications unattended at the bedside unless specifically ordered. Remain with the client until all medications have been administered.</item>

<section id="sect-00004">
<title>Product (Drug) Labeling</title>
<para id="para-00006">Each prescription drug includes a package insert that provides clients with information about the drug. Many package inserts are developed by the manufacturer and approved by the FDA for use by clients and caregivers (FDA, 2023a). Some of the information contained in the inserts include generic and trade names, routes, instructions for taking the drug, and how to store and dispose of the drug. Any side effects, especially if the drug has serious side effects, are listed, as are directions about what to do if adverse effects occur. General information about the safe use of the drug, how to report side effects, and ingredients are also listed. These package inserts are often one of the best resources for free information for the client.</para>

<title>Oral Medications</title>
<para id="para-00007"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">Oral administration</term> encompasses several different drug forms. Liquids, elixirs, suspensions, tablets, capsules, and caplets may all be given orally. Oral administration is usually quick, easy, and convenient, but the onset of action is longer and unpredictable due to the first-pass effect, and not all drugs can be administered this way. <link target-id="table-00001" document="m00102"/> lists the advantages and disadvantages of oral administration.</para>

<para id="para-00014">When administering a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">parenteral medication</term>, such as a subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, it is important to remember that this is an invasive procedure (a needle is inserted into the client). The medication may come in a prefilled syringe; however, it is usually drawn up by the nurse from a vial of medication. The nurse should be very alert during the process of drawing up and administering the medication to keep the needle and contents sterile.</para>

<title>Subcutaneous Administration</title>
<para id="para-00016"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">Subcutaneous injections</term> are administered “under the skin” into the adipose tissue between the dermis and muscular layer (see <link target-id="fig-00003" document="m00102"/>). Clients can be instructed to self-administer injections subcutaneously. Common medications administered within this layer are enoxaparin, heparin, and insulin. Medication administered here is often absorbed slowly due to the reduced number of blood vessels in this area. There are many potential sites for subcutaneous injections: upper arms, thighs, abdomen, back, and buttocks. The specific sites for each drug are usually detailed in the drug’s package insert or labeling. Routine injections should be rotated regularly among the different sites. Do not inject into sites that are hard when palpated. Do not rub the injection site, though gentle pressure may be applied to the area after the drug has been administered.</para>
<figure class="scaled-down" id="fig-00003">
<media alt="Two drawings show what tissue layer different types of injections need to reach and what angle the needle needs to be held at while injecting. The first drawing shows how deep each type of injection needs to go. Intramuscular injections need to reach the muscle; subcutaneous injections need to reach the subcutaneous tissue; intravenous injections need to reach the dermis; and intradermal injections only need to penetrate the epidermis. The second drawing shows the angle the needles need to be at when administering medication. Intramuscular injections need to be at a 90 degree angle, the needle is perpendicular to the skin; subcutaneous injections need to be at a 45 degree angle; intravenous injections need to be at a 25 degree angle; and intradermal injections need to be at a 10 or 15 degree angle, or almost parallel to the skin."><image mime-type="image/png" src="../../media/PHA_Figure_02_03_008.jpg"/></media>

<para id="para-00021">Follow institutional policy about aspiration with IM injections. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) no longer recommend the practice of aspiration for vaccinations because no large blood vessels lie close to the area of injection (CDC, 2023). It is thought that it may cause pain at the site if the syringe is not stable and may actually cause damage to the tissue. At this point in time, there is not enough evidence-based information to support or abort the process of aspiration. Most studies look at the potential discomfort felt with aspiration rather than the safety of intramuscular administration. If the institution recommends aspiration, follow these steps:</para>

The client may bend the elbow to assist with relaxation of the muscle. To determine landmarks, find the acromion process, which will be the base of an upside-down triangle.

<title>IV Administration</title>
<para id="para-00029">If white, cloudy particles appear in the saline lock during administration, immediately stop administering the IV drug. This is a precipitate usually caused by incompatibility between the drug being administered and the solution in the IV line or saline lock. Some drugs may harm the client when used together. Often this is due to a chemical alteration that occurs when used concurrently. Some incompatibilities cause a precipitate or crystals to form; others cause an inactivation of the drug; yet others may cause a toxic solution to form. Immediately clamp the IV or saline lock. Change the administration tubing and restart the infusion. Double-check for Y-site compatibility (when a drug is administered into a Y-site connection with another solution) between the solution and the medication.</para>

<title>Transdermal Patch (or Disk) Application</title>
<para id="para-00030"><term id="term-00019">Transdermal</term> patches are applied to the skin. Patches usually allow for a slow, very controlled release of medication into the skin over a period of hours to days. Common medications that are delivered via this route are nitroglycerin (for angina), fentanyl (for pain), and clonidine (for hypertension). Each drug delivery system is unique, so it is important to read about the individual drug to know the onset and duration of action for the medication delivered by a patch. <link target-id="table-00007" document="m00102"/> lists the advantages and disadvantages of transdermal administration.</para>
