    <title>AChE Inhibitors</title>
    <para id="para-00002"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">AChE inhibitors</term> bind to and interfere with the enzyme AChE. This enzyme is responsible for the destruction of ACh. By inhibiting this enzyme, more internally released ACh is available for use within cholinergic synapses. The result is enhanced transmission by central cholinergic neurons that have not yet been destroyed. Elevated ACh levels in the cortex can slow the neuronal degradation that occurs in this disease. Treatment with AChE inhibitors does not stop the progression of AD but reduces how quickly neurons are destroyed.</para>

    <title>Donepezil</title>
    <para id="para-00003">Donepezil, a centrally acting reversible cholinesterase inhibitor, is used primarily for treatment of mild to severe forms of AD. Centrally acting agents readily cross the blood–brain barrier. Donepezil increases ACh in the brain by preventing its breakdown. Drug absorption is unaffected by food. Peak effects occur in 3–8 hours. Metabolism occurs in the liver, resulting in the production of several pharmacologically active metabolites. Excretion is through the kidneys. An important pharmacokinetic note is that donepezil is highly protein bound (96%); therefore, it has a prolonged half-life of 70 hours. This means that it takes an estimated 15 days for the drug to reach <term id="term-00002">steady state</term>.</para>

    <title>Galantamine</title>
    <para id="para-00006">Galantamine is only used in those with mild to moderate AD. The drug is prepared by extraction from daffodil bulbs. Like donepezil, this drug is a reversible inhibitor of AChE. GI effects are greater than with donepezil but less than with oral rivastigmine (see the next section). Adverse effects are the same as for donepezil with the addition of potential life-threatening skin reactions, such as <term id="term-00005">Stevens–Johnson syndrome</term>. Clients and caregivers should stop the drug and report any signs of a skin rash to their health care provider. As with the other AChE inhibitors, benefits of the drug are modest and short-term. The drug is available in IR and ER tablets as well as an oral solution. Its half-life is 7 hours.</para>

    <section id="sect-00006">
    <title>Rivastigmine</title>
    <para id="para-00007">Rivastigmine is FDA-approved for those with mild to severe AD because it enhances cholinergic function. The manner in which it does so is not fully known. It is believed to increase the ACh concentration by reversible inhibition of its hydrolysis by cholinesterase. Additionally, rivastigmine is used in the management of mild to moderate dementia due to Parkinson’s disease. The drug is available in capsules, oral solution, and a transdermal patch. Peripheral cholinergic effects, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and anorexia, occur more frequently with this drug. Blood levels are lower when using the transdermal route; therefore, the intensity of adverse effects is decreased. The liver does not metabolize this agent, so there are no significant drug–drug interactions.</para>

    <title>Adverse Effects and Contraindications</title>
    <para id="para-00012">Many of the adverse effects caused by AChE inhibitors relate to the stimulation of the PSNS. GI effects are the most common, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, increased salivation, and anorexia. These drugs can cause cardiac-suppressive effects, which can result in symptomatic bradycardia, heart block, and even cardiac arrest. They stimulate the contraction of the bladder muscle and relax the internal sphincter, which causes a sense of urinary urgency for the client. CNS cholinergic effects include miosis, blurred far vision, and difficulty seeing in dim light. Other CNS effects of headaches, dizziness, drowsiness, and possible seizures can also occur. AChE inhibitor drugs can also impair breathing in those with pulmonary disorders, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), due to bronchoconstriction and increased bronchial secretions. Frequent monitoring of the breathing pattern is required. Clients with cardiac conduction disorders should be monitored carefully due to the suppressive effects on cardiac impulses.</para>
    <para id="para-00013">Contraindications include peptic ulcer disease because these drugs increase the secretion of hydrochloric acid in the stomach, which can worsen the ulcer and potentially cause perforation and/or bleeding. Because of the stimulatory effect on the bladder and bowel, anyone with a bladder or bowel obstruction (mechanical or neurologic) should avoid taking these drugs to reduce the risk of rupture.</para>
    <para id="para-00014">Any drugs with anticholinergic effects—such as first-generation histamine-1 receptor antagonists (H1RAs), conventional antipsychotics, and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)—should not be used concurrently because they will reduce or block therapeutic effects of cholinergic agonists. Other parasympathomimetics can cause a synergistic effect if used concurrently. Frequent intake of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or glucocorticoids (steroids) can increase the risk of peptic ulcer disease. Clients taking drugs such as beta blockers (propranolol/metoprolol) or digoxin should be especially careful of significant bradycardia because they both cause negative <term id="term-00015">chronotropic</term> effects.</para>

    <title>NMDA Receptor Antagonist</title>
    <para id="para-00017">Glutamate is the primary excitatory amino acid in the CNS. When glutamate binds to the NMDA receptors, it displaces magnesium from the receptor channel and causes calcium to enter neurons, producing an excitatory effect. The brief period of calcium entry creates a signal in the learning and memory process. Glutamate will then quickly dissociate from the receptor, which permits magnesium to block the channel again. This prevents further calcium influx. If there is a pathological situation, glutamate will slowly but steadily leak from the presynaptic neuron, which prevents magnesium from reblocking the channel and allows calcium to continue entering the neuron. Too much neuronal calcium is toxic, causing neurodegeneration. In addition, excessive calcium overpowers the signal and impairs the memory and learning process.</para>
    <section id="sect-00009">
    <title>Memantine</title>
    <para id="para-00018"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">Memantine</term> (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">Namenda</term>, Namenda XR) is indicated for clients with moderate to severe dementia of the Alzheimer’s type. This drug has been shown to exhibit neuroprotective action (slows the neurotoxicity). Memantine is an antagonist of the NMDA receptor subtype of the glutamate receptor. The drug blocks the influx of calcium when extracellular glutamate is low but permits calcium influx when extracellular glutamate is high. When the glutamate level is low, memantine can occupy the NMDA receptor channel. During this time, the level of intracellular calcium can normalize because no further calcium entry is permitted. During an action potential, a burst of glutamate is released, displacing memantine. This causes a short period of calcium influx. Because intracellular calcium is low, normal signaling of memory and learning can occur. When glutamate moves away from the receptor, memantine reblocks the channel, which stops further calcium entry.</para>
    <para id="para-00019">Memantine ER has a terminal half-life of 60–80 hours; therefore, it can be prescribed once a day. In contrast, the immediate-release form is administered at 10 mg twice daily. A target dose of 5 mg twice daily is recommended in clients with severe renal impairment. This drug is predominately excreted unchanged in the urine. The drug is available in capsule form and administered orally. Any condition or drug that raises urinary pH to 8 or more can reduce drug elimination by 80% (see drug interactions and caution in <link target-id="table-00003" document="m00475"/>), which will result in the accumulation of memantine within the plasma and increase the risk of adverse effects. If a client takes too much memantine, acidifying the urine with K-Phos Neutral or ascorbic acid, for example, will help promote elimination of the drug.</para>

    <para id="para-00028">In July 2023, a new intravenous medication, lecanemab-irmb (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00021">LEQEMBI</term>), received full FDA approval as a treatment for the mild dementia stage of Alzheimer’s disease. The classification of this medication is an amyloid beta-directed antibody. The drug works by targeting harmful amyloid proteins and reducing existing amyloid plaque within the brain. An 18-month study was conducted with a sample of 1,795 people ages 50 to 90 years. The sample was diverse and included individuals from different ethnic and racial backgrounds who were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment. This study concluded that treatment with <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00022">lecanemab-irmb</term> slows the progression of early AD. The drug helped improve participants’ memory as well as their ability solve problems and complete daily activities. Overall, the medication’s main goal is to increase the duration of independence in those with AD. Amyloid-related abnormalities are indicated by a temporary swelling in specific areas of the brain. This is seen using imaging studies. This usually resolves over time. Additional adverse effects may include an allergic reaction, angioedema, or an infusion-related reaction, such as fever, palpitations, dizziness, and/or shortness of breath. To reduce this effect, an individual may be pretreated with antihistamines, anti-inflammatories, or steroids (Eisai, 2023).</para>

    <para id="para-00029">This chapter discussed the disease processes and drug classifications used in managing two irreversible neurodegenerative conditions: myasthenia gravis and Alzheimer’s disease. With one exception, the drug classifications used in both diseases—direct- and indirect-acting cholinergic agonists and AChE inhibitors—essentially make more ACh available for use by the body. The increase in ACh is important for these diseases due to the degeneration of neurons that release ACh, which leads to a deficiency in this neurotransmitter. The NMDA receptor antagonists are the exception to this. This drug class prevents excess calcium influx into the cell, which can cause toxicity and cellular death. Although the medications used will not cure these diseases, they can help with symptom improvement and possibly delay progression of the disease. This allows the client to remain independent in performing their ADLs.</para>
