    <para id="para-00002">Numerous factors can affect the process of providing culturally competent care. Personal factors of the nurse, including their value system, beliefs, and customs, as well as the nurse’s knowledge and attitudes about other cultures, play a role. Cultural factors such as language and communication barriers, gendered roles, and health care practices readily impact the interactions between nurses and clients. Nurses with limited experience interacting with clients from different backgrounds may exhibit biases, othering, and stereotyping in their approach to care.</para>
    <section id="sect-00001">
      <title>Personal Factors</title>
      <para id="para-00003">An individual’s experiences, cultural background, attitudes, age, and educational preparation are all factors that can affect cultural competence. Younger generations are increasingly more diverse (Pew Research Center, 2018), and older individuals may be less familiar with changing cultural dynamics. Education is also an important factor as it can provide individuals with the knowledge, skills, and critical thinking tools to effectively interact with people from diverse backgrounds. Individuals educated in a diverse environment and with some cross-cultural knowledge may be more adept at interactions with people outside their own culture (Sharifi, 2019). Socialization, personality, and prior experiences also play a role, as people who were raised in diverse communities or have experience traveling may feel more comfortable interacting with people from different cultures in a variety of settings, such as in the workplace, in social situations, and in their community.</para>

      <title>Biases and Stereotyping</title>
      <para id="para-00004"><term id="term-00001">Biases</term> are prejudicial attitudes or preconceptions that act as filters to the way people perceive, interpret, and react to the world. These opinions or beliefs (involving gender, race, age, or other categories) affect decision making in subtle and overt ways. When nurses focus only on certain information while ignoring other relevant data, biases can lead to incorrect assumptions, judgments, and actions. In health care, biases can cause health care workers to draw false conclusions, lead to disparities in diagnoses and treatments, result in unequal access to services and resources, and result in slower response times for individuals belonging to certain groups, such as people of color, those who identify as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">LGBTQ+</term>, and people belonging to different religions. Finally, biases can lead nurses to ignore their own prejudices, resulting in a lack of cultural sensitivity and respect.</para>
      <para id="para-00005"><term id="term-00003">Stereotyping</term> is the act of ascribing certain characteristics or behaviors to a person based on their membership in a particular group. This can involve making assumptions about people based on their perceived race, ethnicity, religion, gender identity, age, socioeconomic status, ability, or sexual orientation. Stereotyping can lead to assumptions and generalizations about individuals and groups that may not be accurate or fair. In health care, stereotyping can have a negative impact if it leads to unequal, inadequate, or inappropriate client care. Stereotyping can also prevent health care providers from effectively communicating with and understanding the needs of their clients, which can negatively impact the quality of care that clients receive. To guard against the harmful effects of stereotyping, nurses must gather and utilize accurate information about their clients as individuals, rather than relying on learned, and potentially damaging, assumptions.</para>

      <title>Othering</title>
      <para id="para-00006"><term id="term-00004">Othering</term> is the process of excluding, marginalizing, or differentiating individuals or groups based on their perceived differences from the dominant group in a society. Othering is used to separate or exclude individuals who may not fit within social norms or expectations. It often involves ascribing negative characteristics or traits to individuals or groups based on their perceived differences, implying that a person or group are inferior. This can lead to discrimination, feelings of isolation, and social inequality. Othering can take many forms, such as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">racism</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">sexism</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">homophobia</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008"> ableism</term>, and other varieties of discrimination. The practice of othering can have harmful effects on individuals and communities, as it can create barriers to social inclusion, equal opportunities, and fair treatment. It can also reinforce negative stereotypes and prejudices and can prevent individuals and groups from being treated with dignity and respect.</para>

      <title>Developing Self-awareness</title>
      <para id="para-00007"><term id="term-00009">Self-awareness</term> is an important step in developing cultural competence and cultural humility (Foronda et al., 2018). It involves understanding one’s own values and beliefs, how they are influenced by one’s cultural background, and how they influence one’s perceptions and behaviors. To develop self-awareness, nurses can start by reflecting on their experiences, cultural background, biases, and stereotypes, and how these may impact their views of people from different backgrounds.</para>
      <para id="para-00008">There are a number of tools and approaches for working toward this self-awareness. One example is the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">Implicit Association Test (IAT)</term>, a psychological tool used to measure bias and the effect that unconscious attitudes and beliefs have on day-to-day decision making. People of any background can use the IAT to identify hidden biases that may affect their objective evaluation and treatment of others. Once biases are identified, nurses can challenge their biases by engaging in open and respectful conversations with individuals from different backgrounds and asking those individuals questions to learn more about their experiences and perspectives.</para>
      <para id="para-00009">Participating in organizations that embrace and promote diversity can also help nurses develop self-awareness and cultural competence. Examples of such activities may include attending cultural events, volunteering at health clinics that serve immigrant communities, or attending an interfaith service. By engaging in these activities, nurses can continue to learn and grow in their understanding of working with individuals and groups from diverse cultural backgrounds, building the skills and knowledge necessary to provide compassionate, culturally congruent care to their clients.</para>
      <para id="para-00010">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">Colorado Education Initiative</term> has developed a Cultural Competence Self-Awareness Checklist that individuals  can use to check their progress toward developing cultural competence.</para>

      <title>Barriers to Providing Culturally Competenet Care</title>
      <para id="para-00014">Nurses face multiple barriers to providing culturally competent care. They often lack knowledge of different cultural norms and values, face language and communication barriers, and resort to stereotyping due to lack of cultural awareness and limited cultural diversity among health care providers. These challenges can lead to misunderstandings and misdiagnoses, as well as poor client outcomes. In addition, ethnocentrism, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">gendered roles</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">organizational barriers</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">structural inequities</term> present challenges.</para>
      <section id="sect-00006">
        <title>Ethnocentrism</title>
        <para id="para-00015"><term id="term-00015">Ethnocentrism</term> is the belief that one's own cultural values, traditions, and practices are superior to those of other cultures (Bizumic &amp; Duckitt, 2012). Ethnocentrism involves judging others by the standards of one’s own culture, assuming that one’s own culture is the norm, or standard, against which all others should be measured. Ethnocentrism can lead to a lack of understanding and respect for other cultures and can result in discrimination, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">bias</term>, and even violence. Nurses need to be aware of their own ethnocentric tendencies, striving to be more culturally aware and culturally sensitive. Practicing cultural humility allows one to recognize the biases created by ethnocentrism, emphasizing the client’s values, rather than those of the nurse or the dominant culture ((Foronda &amp; Baptiste, 2022).</para>

        <title>Gendered Roles</title>
        <para id="para-00016"><term id="term-00017">Gender roles</term> and expectations can have a major impact on how individuals from various cultures seek and respond to care. Nursing is often viewed as a gendered role because it has traditionally been associated with women. This gendered association can affect the way that the profession is perceived and valued and can impact interactions between nurses and clients. Nurses should recognize that people of different genders may have varying needs and expectations when it comes to health care. For example, individuals from some cultures may require separate rooms for male and female clients or may prefer that a nurse of the same gender as the client provides care. Understanding how gender and gender roles are viewed from different cultural perspectives can help nurses recognize how gender impacts decision-making, health beliefs, and behaviors of clients when it comes to seeking health care.</para>

      <section id="sect-00008">
        <title>Organizational Barriers</title>
        <para id="para-00017">Barriers to cultural competence also occur within organizations. These barriers can be far-reaching in scope as they extend well beyond the individual. Factors such as staff education, diversity among health care providers, policies and procedures for addressing cultural differences, and access to language services can all impact the ability of nurses to provide culturally congruent care. Organizational leadership plays a key role in designing and implementing policies that support an inclusive workplace and the provision of culturally and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">linguistically competent services</term> (Office of Minority Health, 2013). Furthermore, since cultural competence is a process, there must be a commitment to updating and maintaining programs and policies that support it.</para>

      <section id="sect-00009">
        <title>Structural Inequities</title>
        <para id="para-00018"><term id="term-00019">Structural inequities</term> in health care refer to the systemic barriers and disparities that exist in the health care system that prevent certain individuals or groups from receiving high-quality care. These inequities can be caused by a range of factors, including discriminatory policies and practices, unequal access to health care resources, and inadequate representation of certain groups in the health care workforce.</para>
        <para id="para-00019">One example of a structural inequity in health care is the unequal distribution of health care resources, such as diagnostic and treatment facilities, across different communities. For example, individuals in rural areas or those living in communities of lower socioeconomic status may have limited access to specialized medical care. This lack of access to care can have a significant impact on population health, as it can result in individuals not receiving the care they need, leading to an increase in preventable illnesses and chronic conditions and disparities in health outcomes, with individuals living in under-served areas often experiencing worse health outcomes than those living in more affluent areas.</para>
        <para id="para-00020">Another example of a structural inequity in health care is the lack of representation of certain groups in the health care workforce. For instance, Black and Latinx individuals are underrepresented in the medical nursing professions, which can lead to a lack of cultural competency and culturally congruent care for clients from these backgrounds and a reduction in the quality of care provided.</para>
