<para id="para-00001">Endocrine disorders, such as diabetes and thyroid disease, require careful diet and lifestyle management. Accordingly, nurses play a critical role in promoting nutrition for endocrine wellness. For example, nurses instructing clients with diabetes on proper nutrition can significantly improve their clients’ glycemic control (Martos-Cabrera et al., 2021). Nurses can collaborate with other healthcare professionals to develop comprehensive treatment plans for clients with endocrine disorders. Multidisciplinary interventions can improve glycemic control and reduce hospitalizations in clients with type 2 diabetes (Ni et al., 2019).</para>
