<para id="para-00002">In the process of EBP and EBDM, nurses and other health care providers need to understand how to evaluate the quality of evidence. Furthermore, they need to understand why this evaluation should take place. Taking the necessary steps to evaluate the quality of each piece of evidence ensures that each adds value to the project and helps meet the user’s needs and expectations. This process may also help identify gaps in what has previously been researched and/or implemented.</para>

<title>Evaluating the Evidence</title>
<para id="para-00006">After understanding the levels of evidence available during the literature review, the next step is to appraise the evidence. The three main steps in evidence appraisal are identifying the type of evidence, determining the evidence level and strength, and then evaluating the quality of the evidence.</para>
<para id="para-00007"><term id="term-00003">Evidence appraisal</term> entails reviewing acquired information and systematically assessing its intended audience, purpose, relevance, applicability, validity, and reliability. The <term id="term-00004">intended audience</term> is the demographic that the writer or writers expect to read and interact with the information. The <term id="term-00005">purpose</term> of an article, often presented in a purpose statement early in the article, identifies the reason for the project or study. An article’s statement of purpose can help  a nurse to quickly identify whether the article will help answer the research question. Furthermore, the article should be reviewed for <term id="term-00006">relevance</term>, meaning how closely the source’s elements relate to the research question and whether the results can be applied to the intended population. <term id="term-00007">Applicability</term>, or how well the results and data pertain to a broad or specific population, is an important piece of appraisal. <term id="term-00008">Validity</term> refers to the degree to which the information within the article is factual. This is sometimes referred to as accuracy or credibility in research articles. Correspondingly, <term id="term-00009">reliability</term> is the extent to which results can be reproduced if research is completed under the same conditions. <link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00157"/> demonstrates the search pyramid tools researchers use to rank the evidence they gather. Each level of evidence pulls from the research obtained at lower levels, meaning the highest and most synthesized information is at the top of the pyramid. The highest quality, most reliable evidence from the highest level of the decision pyramid is most likely to support effective action and should be used first.</para>
<figure class="scaled-down" id="fig-00001"><media alt="A pyramid shows different types of evidence, with quality of evidence increasing as you move up the pyramid. Starting at the bottom, the types of evidence are studies, synopses of single studies, syntheses, synopses of syntheses, summaries, and systems."><image mime-type="image/jpg" src="../../media/PH_Figure_11_03_003.png"/></media>

<para id="para-00008">Using research databases, Amari and Milo found four quantitative studies and three qualitative studies regarding exercise and mental health. Additionally, they surveyed the community to identify components of community exercise programs. This survey included physical locations, cost, and general attendance of these classes and programs. They also spoke with the local school systems to determine how physical education is incorporated into the high school curriculum. Amari and Milo must now appraise the evidence in order to select which data points to use and to what degree.</para>

<para id="para-00013">Each article or source identified in the literature review of a project should be appraised considering the aspects discussed above. <link url="https://openstax.org/r/upstate">The Johns Hopkins Toolkit</link> provides a guide to evidence level and quality, which can facilitate this process. Once this appraisal has been completed, the sources can be categorized and ranked to determine which ones may be helpful to use as a foundation for the research ahead. Nurses should use this process to identify strong research that can support the outcomes of their EBP intervention.</para>

  <title>The Final Step in the EBDM Process</title><newline/>
  <para id="para-00068">Read the scenario, and then respond to the questions that follow.</para>
<para id="para-00014">Throughout this chapter, Amari and Milo have applied the EBDM process to a concern in their community. This segment reveals the outcome of their process. Read the scenario, and then respond to the following questions.</para>
<para id="para-00015">After synthesizing the data, Amari and Milo note that consistent interventions discussed to support mental health in adolescents are regular exercise, appropriate sleep, and relaxation techniques. Specifically, the literature supports structured exercise classes and group movement as a successful method to reduce adolescent anxiety.</para>
<para id="para-00016">While the research supports specific interventions, as public health nurses, Amari and Milo know they need to also take into consideration the NCCMT Model for evidence-based decision-making as it incorporates research, community health issues in the local context, community and political preferences and actions, public health resources, and public health expertise. With that, their assessment notes the limited access to workout facilities such as public gyms for many of the adolescents in the community. Additionally, they note a high price for membership compared to the average family income. They are also aware that many adolescents in the community work to help support themselves and their families. This not only limits their time availability but also speaks to the additional monetary strain. After speaking with a representative of the public school system, they note that physical education classes are optional for high school juniors and seniors. They find many students opt out of this class as their other option is early release or study hall.</para>
<para id="para-00017">Due to all these factors, the nurses identify that although the literature is clear on a specific intervention for exercise, it may not be the best option for their current community. Instead, the two decide they can still implement interventions for daily exercise that consider these community factors.</para>
<para id="para-00018">This leads them to the adapt phase. They decide to implement the following interventions:</para>
<para id="para-00019">Offer free daily classes at the community health center lead by volunteers. These classes will be offered at two different times each day and will be available to all adolescents within the community.</para>
<para id="para-00020">Compile a list of free exercise resources on the health department website that adolescents can use directly by streaming them at home, if possible, or in the community center with free internet. Additionally, Amari and Milo have worked with the high school and obtained support for two computers to be used for this resource that will be available for students during their study hall.</para>
<para id="para-00021">Each participant who attends a class will sign in to track use of this resource. Those who access the electronic resources will have a unique log-in passcode. These will be used to track the amount of exercise over 3 months for each participant. This data will then be looked at in comparison to the level of anxiety reported by adolescents in the community.</para>
<para id="para-00022">After three months of implementation, Amari and Milo review the rates of exercise and rates of anxiety for adolescents in the community. They find a decrease in anxiety for those who participated in exercise at least 5 times a week. Due to these results, the nurses begin brainstorming how they can expand these interventions. They will support daily exercise but note that activity at least 5 days a week helps reduce anxiety. They plan to obtain data for three more months and then disseminate their results at that time.</para>
