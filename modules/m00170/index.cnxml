<para id="para-00002">In the 20th century, improvements in sanitation and hygiene, the discovery of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">antibiotics</term>, and the implementation of immunization programs resulted in disease control and a major shift in life expectancy and the diseases causing death (CDC, 1999). By 1900, 40 states had established health departments, and from the 1930s to the 1950s, they oversaw progress in sewage disposal, water treatment, food safety, and handwashing and food-handling education. Improvements in housing and TB-control programs decreased the incidence of TB deaths (CDC, 1999). In addition to these public health achievements, 1946 saw the creation of the Communicable Disease Center (CDC) with a primary mission of preventing the spread of malaria (CDC, 2018c). Over the next 40 years, the CDC provided disease surveillance and immunization programs. In 1992, it was officially renamed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to reflect its leadership in public health initiatives (CDC, 2023b). Communicable disease control and prevention is one of the greatest public health achievements of the 20th century (CDC, 1999). The development of new vaccines has continued into the 21st century, resulting in fewer serious illnesses and deaths due to VPDs. Eight of the 10 <link url="https://openstax.org/r/injury">leading causes of death</link> for 2021 were related to chronic diseases, a significant shift from the last century (CDC, 2023h). Chronic diseases such as heart disease and cancer are leading causes of death and disability and the primary drivers of annual health care costs (CDC, 2021b). This evolution in infectious disease prevention and control would not have occurred without the efforts of public health professionals who recognized the importance of sanitation, education, vaccine development, and public health surveillance.</para>

<title>Public Health Surveillance</title>
<para id="para-00003"><term id="term-00002">Public health surveillance</term> is the “ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health-related data essential to planning, implementation, and evaluation of public health practice” (CDC, 2018b, para 1) and more specifically refers to the monitoring of communicable diseases, noncommunicable diseases, injuries, and risk factors for these health outcomes in a population. Using data to monitor health problems is a key function of public health surveillance as it assists in prevention or control. Public health officials can use data to prioritize planning prevention and control programs (CDC, 2012).</para>
<para id="para-00004">While numerous health issues affect global populations, many are neither urgent nor directly threaten health. Some health issues, such as breast cancer, are persistent and chronic, with a stable incidence and prevalence in the community. Therefore, the first step in public health surveillance is to identify which health problems to monitor. Selecting and prioritizing health problems for surveillance involves identifying issues that impact public health. The second step relates to the incidence, prevalence, severity, mortality, socioeconomic impact, and communicability of the disease or problem and the ability to prevent or control it. In general, communicable diseases are more commonly under surveillance, given their possibility of causing an increased threat to public health. Within the United States, surveillance begins at local and state-level public health departments as each state sets local laws for diseases and conditions that must be reported. Local health departments work with laboratories, hospitals, and health care providers to obtain information on reportable diseases and then convey it to the state health department. The state health department uses the data to locate the source of a potential outbreak to prevent its spread and sometimes will involve the CDC depending on the scope of the issue (CDC, 2022aj).</para>
<para id="para-00005">Local and state health departments are also responsible for notifying the CDC about agreed-upon notifiable diseases and health conditions. The <link url="https://openstax.org/r/cste">Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists</link> and the CDC identify this list together, and states voluntarily inform the CDC when an individual meets the criteria to become a case. The CDC then uses this data to monitor and alert communities about potential health threats (CDC, 2022aj). The CDC also partners with the WHO through the <link url="https://openstax.org/r/goarn"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network</term></link> (Christensen et al., 2021).</para>
<para id="para-00006">The CDC conducts public health surveillance through the <link url="https://openstax.org/r/nndss"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System</term></link> (NNDSS) to track reportable and notifiable diseases and conditions with the assistance of local health departments. Currently, approximately 120 diseases are under NNDSS surveillance, including communicable and noncommunicable diseases and bioterrorism agents, with almost 2.7 million disease cases reported each year (CDC, 2022aj).</para>
<para id="para-00007">Each time a public health agency collects information about an individual diagnosed with a health condition that could threaten others, it is called <term id="term-00005">case surveillance</term>. This case surveillance is at the foundation of public health practice. Recall John Snow’s cholera outbreak investigation in London in <link document="m00158">Epidemiology for Informing Population/Community Health Decisions</link>. Case surveillance usually includes infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, or foodborne outbreaks, like <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis>. However, some noninfectious conditions are also surveilled, such as lead poisoning (CDC, 2022aj). Health departments notify the CDC to report instances of an estimated 120 diseases and conditions monitored under NNDSS surveillance. Case surveillance captures information about the population affected, the geographical area involved, and the course of illness and treatment that public health professionals can use to inform prevention and control efforts (CDC, 2022aj).</para>
<para id="para-00008">A surveillance <term id="term-00006">case definition</term> is a set of criteria used to define a disease for public health surveillance. Case definitions include clinical criteria such as expected signs or symptoms and often have restrictions by time, place, and person, especially in the setting of potential health threats to others. This enables public health officials to be consistent in case classifications and counting across states. Surveillance case definitions are not the criteria that health care providers use to diagnose, manage, and treat conditions in the clinical setting; they are used for data reporting and tracking purposes only (CDC, 2022ah). Surveillance data are also included in the CDC’s <link url="https://openstax.org/r/mmwr"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</term></link> (MMWR) series. This publication is the agency’s main dissemination of authoritative, useful public health information and recommendations. MMWR is targeted toward scientists, health professionals, epidemiologists, and public health professionals, including public health and community health nurses (CDC, 2023k).</para>

<title>Outbreak Investigation</title>
<para id="para-00010">A disease <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">outbreak</term> refers to more cases of a certain disease or health condition than expected. Gathering surveillance data is one method of establishing the existence of an outbreak. This process can occur at the local or state health department and in hospital facilities looking to identify any hospital-acquired infections. Similarly, the CDC regularly reviews surveillance data and laboratory patterns of disease-causing organisms to detect clusters of illness. Another way to detect an outbreak is when a health care provider alerts the local health department about unusual cases—unusual due to the frequency or type of condition. An example is the 1999 WNV infection, which was discovered after a New York City health department received a call from a physician who had recently evaluated two clients with encephalitis (CDC, 2012, pp. 6–2). Community members may also call local health departments to report abnormal clusters of illness. An example is foodborne-related illness where an individual calls the health department and reports that seven of their friends are ill with similar symptoms after eating at the same restaurant. Another example would be a concerned community member reporting a cancer cluster in their neighborhood. A health department’s decision to investigate a potential outbreak depends on many factors, such as illness severity, number of cases, mode of transmission, and availability of prevention and control measures (<link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00170"/>). Typically, the more individuals affected or the more serious the illness, the greater the likelihood of an outbreak investigation with the ultimate goal to assist in disease prevention and control (CDC, 2012).</para>

<title>Surveillance for and Prevention of Foodborne Diseases</title>
<para id="para-00012">Prevention of foodborne diseases requires careful oversight and monitoring along the food supply chain. The CDC works collaboratively with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and local and state public health departments to ensure food safety along the steps in the food chain. This work involves identifying foodborne illness, investigating multistate foodborne disease outbreaks, providing education to prevent outbreaks, and implementing systems to better address, detect, and stop outbreaks (CDC, 2022b). The CDC helps to track and investigate foodborne illnesses through the following surveillance systems:</para>

WGS data helps scientists determine DNA similarities in strains of pathogens, indicating they come from the same source and allowing the CDC and its partners to detect outbreaks more quickly and to solve outbreaks while they are still small. When PulseNet scientists determine the same strain causes a group of illnesses, disease detectives can investigate the illness to determine if they came from the same food or food source (<link target-id="fig-00002" document="m00170"/>). This has improved the ability to link foodborne illnesses and detect outbreaks (CDC, 2022b).</para>

<title>Surveillance for and Prevention of Waterborne Diseases</title>
<para id="para-00015">Preventing waterborne illnesses is multifaceted. Consumers need to know where their drinking water comes from and understand their water supply’s testing frequency and test results. Many community water systems use groundwater and are regulated by the EPA, but some municipal water supplies are unsafe, as was the case for years in Flint, Michigan (CDC, 2022ac; Ruckart et al., 2019). Private wells must also be maintained and tested to ensure they are far enough away from septic tanks (CDC, 2022ac). The CDC provides guidance to consumers about ways to mitigate waterborne pathogens that can grow in pipes and devices that use water, such as humidifiers. Pathogens thrive in stagnant water or water that is not treated with enough disinfectant. Due to EPA requirements, public water utilities provide water that meets certain quality and safety standards, but tap water is not sterile. The small number of pathogens in the water can congregate in pipes and potentially multiply, especially if taps are unused for long periods and water sits in the pipes (CDC, 2022ac).</para>

<para id="para-00018">A <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">waterborne disease outbreak</term> is defined when two or more individuals contract the same illness from the same contaminated water source. Waterborne disease surveillance data informs policy in developing drinking water regulations and regulations for certain recreational water activities (CDC, 2019f). The CDC oversees waterborne disease and outbreak tracking to help guide efforts to decrease and prevent future outbreaks. The national <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">Waterborne Disease and Outbreak Surveillance System</term> (<link url="https://openstax.org/r/cdchealthywater">WBDOSS</link>) collects data on waterborne illnesses related to recreational, drinking, and environmental water (CDC, 2019f). The WBDOSS also gathers information on hospitalizations, deaths, agents, types of water implicated, and water settings, which collectively inform next steps during an outbreak. Determining the etiology of waterborne illness is a complicated process as many pathogens spread by water can also be spread in other ways, making it difficult to link illness to water. Without an outbreak investigation, it is nearly impossible to link illness to water (CDC, 2019g). Therefore, anyone suspecting a possible outbreak is encouraged to contact their local health department, which will often enlist the assistance of the state health department (CDC, 2019h).</para>
<para id="para-00019">Waterborne disease outbreaks became nationally notifiable in 2009, and every state is responsible for identifying, investigating, and reporting them electronically through the CDC’s National Outbreak Reporting System (<link url="https://openstax.org/r/nors">NORS</link>). WBDOSS collects the data reported to NORS on waterborne disease and outbreaks associated with recreational water, drinking water, and non-recreational water exposures (CDC, 2019h) and publishes annual surveillance data reports in the MMWR (CDC, 2019k). These data have supported efforts to reduce waterborne disease outbreaks by assisting the EPA in developing drinking water regulations, guiding the CDC’s recreational water activities program, and highlighting the emergence of Legionella outbreaks through various exposures and settings, supporting prevention efforts (CDC, 2019k).</para>

<title>Nurse’s Role During an Infectious Disease Outbreak</title>
<para id="para-00020">Nursing plays a distinct role in pandemics and other infectious disease outbreaks. As part of public health nursing’s three core functions, nurses are involved with assessment in terms of epidemiological surveillance and detection, such as contact tracing. A school nurse working in New York City is credited with first observing and notifying the CDC about the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [NASEM], 2021). During the COVID-19 pandemic, nurses conducted most contact tracing at the local board of health, at the state level, and in school districts. Public health nurses assist with coordinating and implementing disaster plans at the local and state levels, an aspect of policy development. Preparedness is a multidisciplinary effort to understand a health care system’s capacity in advance of a public health emergency, including workforce capacity, access to personal protective equipment, and medical supplies, an aspect of assurance (NASEM, 2021).</para>
<para id="para-00021">During an evolving infectious disease outbreak, the nursing role may shift as health care shifts from routine care to public health care, emergency preparedness, and disaster response. Nurses working in various practice settings serve on the frontline of public health emergencies, assisting individuals and communities through a crisis. Promoting health and well-being is one of the essential roles of nursing. Nurses engage and connect with individuals and communities to ensure they have what they need to be healthy (NASEM, 2021).</para>
<para id="para-00022">As the COVID-19 pandemic revealed, this engagement, ability, and willingness to respond to public health crises takes a toll on nursing; during that pandemic, many nurses reported feeling unsafe, unsupported, and unprepared, resulting in a profound mental health burden (NASEM, 2021). The COVID-19 pandemic required nurses to take on multiple different roles: for example, outpatient endoscopy nurses were asked to care for medical-surgical clients, and non–critical care nurses were asked for care for critically ill clients. Nurses also provided end-of-life care and served as a means of communication between dying or ill clients and their families. This most recent pandemic has illustrated the vital importance of protecting nurses’ well-being and mental health so that they can respond to disasters effectively and safely (NASEM, 2021).</para>
<para id="para-00023">Nurses also have a role within the health promotion and disease prevention framework along the three levels of prevention. Within an infectious disease outbreak, the public health nurse plays a vital role in primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention (<link target-id="table-00001" document="m00170"/>).</para>

<title>Chapter Summary</title>
<para id="para-00174">Outbreaks occur when there are more than the expected number of cases of a certain health condition. Local health care providers, state or local data surveillance, or the CDC’s review of surveillance data and laboratory patterns detect illness clusters to identify outbreaks. Public health surveillance uses data to monitor communicable and noncommunicable diseases, injuries, and risk factors for health outcomes in a population and prevent or control them. Steps in outbreak prevention include preparation; establishing an outbreak’s existence; forming a case definition; finding cases; conducting descriptive epidemiology; developing, evaluating, and refining the hypothesis about the cause; implementing control and prevention measures; maintaining surveillance; and communicating the findings. Nursing’s distinct role in pandemics and outbreaks includes assessment (epidemiological surveillance) and detection (contact tracing). Public health nurses assist with coordinating and implementing local and state disaster plans and participate in the multidisciplinary effort of understanding a health care system’s capacity before a public health emergency.</para>
