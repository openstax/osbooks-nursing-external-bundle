<para id="para-00002">Bisphosphonates, calcium preparations, vitamin D, and estrogen receptor modulators may seem out of context in this chapter; however, they are included because of their effects on postmenopausal clients who no longer produce sufficient estrogen and are at increased risk of osteopenia and osteoporosis. <term id="term-00001">Osteopenia</term> is a condition in which bone mass is decreased, causing bones to become weaker. <term id="term-00002">Osteoporosis</term> is a condition in which bone mass has decreased to the point that bones become brittle and are much more likely to fracture (Fink, 2019; Zareef &amp; Jackson, 2021; National Institutes of Health, 2022).</para>

<para id="para-00004">Bisphosphonates are a category of drugs used to prevent and treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal clients. Vitamin D and calcium may be used as an adjunct with bisphosphonate therapy. Weight-bearing exercises, such as walking for 30 minutes several days a week, should be included as part of client education. Routine bone density testing should be scheduled to determine the effectiveness of the drug therapy (DailyMed; Fink, 2019).</para>

<title>Adverse Effects and Contraindications</title>
<para id="para-00006">Adverse effects of bisphosphonates include decreased serum calcium and serum phosphate levels, arthralgia, myalgia, stomach pain, difficulty swallowing, heartburn, and irritation or pain of the esophagus. One major adverse effect from bisphosphonate therapy is osteonecrosis of the jaw (Madhumati, &amp; Gonegandla, 2020). The bisphosphonate accumulates in the jaw at a higher rate than in other bones and causes increased new bone formation. As a result, the older bone lacks sufficient blood supply and begins to die or become necrosed. This complication occurs more often in clients with cancer and in those who have invasive dental procedures. Thus, invasive dental procedures should not be performed while a client is receiving bisphosphonates.</para>
<para id="para-00007">Contraindications to bisphosphonates include any esophageal abnormality that prevents adequate and timely emptying of the stomach. Additionally, bisphosphonates should not be used if the client is unable to sit up or stand for at least 30 minutes after taking the medication, to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation. Severe renal insufficiency is another instance where bisphosphonates should not be used.</para>

<title>Calcium Preparations</title>
<para id="para-00009">Calcium, the most abundant mineral in the body, is necessary for bone development and bone maintenance. In fact, about 98% of the body’s calcium is stored in the bones. Calcium from food and supplements is absorbed by both active transport and passive diffusion across the intestinal mucosa. Vitamin D is essential for calcium absorption and for maintaining adequate calcium levels. Estrogen is also important for maintaining bone health; thus, during menopause when females produce less estrogen, they have a considerable risk of developing osteopenia and osteoporosis (National Institutes of Health, 2022).</para>
<para id="para-00010">Food sources of calcium include dairy, salmon, dark green vegetables (broccoli, kale, spinach), and other foods with high levels of oxalic acid such as sweet potatoes, rhubarb, and beans. Calcium supplements vary widely as to their source and the amount of calcium contained in the tablets (National Institutes of Health, 2022).</para>
<para id="para-00011"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">Calcium supplements</term> include <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">calcium acetate</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">calcium citrate</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">calcium gluconate</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">calcium chloride</term>. Calcium supplements used to treat osteoporosis and osteopenia are administered orally; dosages depend on the specific type of calcium supplement being prescribed and the reason for its use. Calcium carbonate and calcium citrate are the two most common forms of calcium used in supplements. Calcium has varying rates of absorption depending on the specific supplement, an individual’s level of stomach acid, and the fat content in a meal eaten when a calcium supplement is taken. The greater the fat content, the less calcium is absorbed. Calcium gluconate and calcium chloride are administered intravenously and used for serious and life-threatening acute hypocalcemia, hyperkalemia, and certain cardiac emergencies. See <emphasis effect="bold"><link document="m00300">Fluids and Electrolytes, Vitamins, Minerals, and Alternative Therapies</link></emphasis> for more information about calcium and Vitamin D.</para>
<section id="sect-00006">
<title>Adverse Effects and Contraindications</title>
<para id="para-00012">Adverse effects of calcium supplements are usually GI related and include abdominal pain, gas, bloating, constipation, and nausea. Hypercalcemia can lead to poor muscle tone, renal insufficiency, weight loss, fatigue, polyuria, and heart arrhythmias.</para>
<para id="para-00013">Contraindications and precautions are necessary depending on the client’s chronic diseases and other medications being taken. Clients with heart disease and renal disease may need closer monitoring of calcium levels. Calcium supplements generally decrease stomach acid necessary for the metabolism and absorption of other medications. Levothyroxine is one example; it should be taken at least 30 minutes prior to or 2 hours after calcium. So, a complete medication history is important in planning calcium supplementation.</para>
</section>
</section>
<section id="sect-00007">
<title>Vitamin D</title>
<para id="para-00014">Along with calcium supplements, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">vitamin D</term> should be taken either as a separate supplement or included in the calcium supplement. The best source of vitamin D is sunlight. The appropriate amount of time for sun exposure is determined by the skin type based on Fitzpatrick’s skin typing, which ranges from I (fair skin that burns easily) to VI (skin that is always tan) (National Institutes of Health, 2022; Sakamoto, 2019; Zareef &amp; Jackson, 2021). The use of sunscreen during sun exposure is controversial as far as the effect on vitamin D; however, the client should take care to avoid sunburn (AIM at Melanoma Foundation, n.d.).</para>
<para id="para-00015">Other sources of vitamin D include fatty fish (such as trout, salmon, tuna, and mackerel) and fish liver oils, and fortified foods such as milk and cereals (National Institutes of Health, 2022).</para>

<section id="sect-00008">
<title>Estrogen Receptor Modulators</title>
<para id="para-00016"><term id="term-00018">Estrogen receptor modulators (ERMs)</term> are not hormones. They are estrogen receptor site agonists or antagonists. ERMs possess some of the positive effects of estrogen and have fewer adverse effects. Raloxifene and toremifene are the drugs discussed in this section.</para>
<section id="sect-00009">
<title>Raloxifene</title>
<para id="para-00017">Raloxifene is used to prevent and treat postmenopausal osteoporosis by increasing bone density. Contraindications include allergy, pregnancy, and lactation. Caution should be used for clients with a history of deep vein thrombosis and/or smoking because of the risk of clot development. Adverse effects are like those of estrogen and can include skin rash and edema. Raloxifene dosage is 60 mg daily orally.</para>
