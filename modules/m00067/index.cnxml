  <title>Normal Function of the Renal System</title>
  <para id="para-00002">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">renal system</term> contains the kidneys, urinary bladder, ureters, and urethra (<link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00067"/>) The <term id="term-00002">kidneys</term> (the primary organs in this system) filter blood and remove serum wastes, excrete wastes from the body, maintain blood pressure (National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, n.d.), maintain acid-base balance, and balance fluids. The kidneys are also responsible for <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">reabsorption</term> of glucose, amino acids, bicarbonate, water, and phosphate, as well as chloride, sodium, magnesium, calcium, and potassium ions (Newman, 2023).</para>

  <para id="para-00003">There are two <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">kidneys</term>, each located between the twelfth thoracic and third lumbar vertebrae on either side of the vertebral column. The right kidney is slightly lower than the left because of the liver. A fibrous connective tissue known as the <term id="term-00005">renal capsule</term> covers the outermost layer of the kidneys (<link target-id="fig-00002" document="m00067"/>).</para>
  <figure class="scaled-down" id="fig-00002"><media alt="A cross-section of a kidney shows the major parts of the kidney.

  <title>Renal Cortex and Medulla</title>
  <para id="para-00004">The next layer of the kidney is the <term id="term-00006">renal cortex</term>, followed by the <term id="term-00007">renal medulla</term>. The renal medulla consists of a series of renal pyramids that contain straight tubular structures and blood vessels. The top point of these pyramid-like structures, known as the <term id="term-00008">renal papilla</term>, points toward the innermost layer of the kidney, called the <term id="term-00009">renal pelvis</term>, which is found within the renal sinus. The renal sinus (cavity) collects urine that is produced by the functioning layer of the kidney, the <term id="term-00010">parenchyma</term> (the renal cortex and medulla together). Inside the parenchyma are the nephrons, the basic functioning units of the kidney (<link target-id="fig-00003" document="m00067"/>).</para>

  <section id="sect-00004">
  <title>Nephrons</title>
  <para id="para-00005">Each kidney has roughly one million nephrons (Cleveland Clinic, 2023b, 2023c). A <term id="term-00011">nephron</term> is the functional unit of the kidney and contains two parts: the <term id="term-00012">glomerulus</term>, which is a cluster of capillaries and nerve endings that cluster around its second part, the renal tubule. Urine created in the nephrons will pass into collecting ducts and flow to the minor calyxes, to the major calyxes, into the renal pelvis, and out of the kidney into the ureter.</para>
  <para id="para-00006">The kidneys remove three primary wastes: urea, uric acid, and drugs and their metabolites. <term id="term-00013">Urea</term> are wastes from protein breakdown, while <term id="term-00014">uric acid</term> is waste from the breakdown of nucleic acids (Newman, 2023).</para>
  </section>
  <section id="sect-00005">
  <title>Hormone Production</title>
  <para id="para-00007">The kidneys also play a role in the production of certain <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">hormones</term> that support other body processes. For example, they help balance blood pressure by retaining water and sodium in the body; they also produce <term id="term-00016">renin</term> that helps to maintain appropriate blood pressure by managing water reabsorption (Merck Manuals, 2023). The kidneys assist with red blood cell production: they create and release <term id="term-00017">erythropoietin</term>, a hormone that signals the bone marrow to produce red blood cells. Another hormone, calcitriol, which is a form of vitamin D that helps the body absorb calcium and regulates the parathyroid hormone, is produced by the kidneys. The kidneys also help to raise glucose levels through employing <term id="term-00018">gluconeogenesis</term>—the formation of glucose from precursors—in the renal cortex.</para>
  </section>
  <section id="sect-00006">
  <title>Renal Artery, Renal Vein, and Ureters</title>
  <para id="para-00008">Two other important kidney components are the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">renal artery</term> and the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020">renal vein</term>. The renal artery controls blood flow to the kidneys for both supply to the organ and for filtering purposes. Blood flows through this artery at a rate of 1.2 liters per minute (Dalal, Bruss, &amp; Sehdev, 2022). The renal vein carries filtered blood back to the heart, away from the kidneys.</para>
  <para id="para-00009">The <term id="term-00021">ureters</term> are small tubes that run from the renal pelvis to the urinary bladder, allowing for urine passage (National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, n.d.). The urine is moved by way of peristalsis, or the involuntary constriction and relaxation of musculature that promotes movement. The layers of the ureters include the fibrous coat (outer layer), the muscular coat (middle layer), and the mucosa (inner layer).</para>
  </section>
  <section id="sect-00007">
  <title>Bladder</title>
  <para id="para-00010">The urine that passes down the ureters travels to the <term id="term-00022">urinary bladder</term>, a temporary storage area for urine located in the pelvic cavity, posterior to the <term id="term-00023">symphysis pubis</term>. The layers of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">bladder</term> include the outer superior surface layer, the parietal peritoneum, and the outer fibrous connective tissue. The detrusor muscle is made up of interwoven smooth muscle fibers that control the contraction of the bladder during urination; the submucosa, which supports the mucous membrane and is composed of connective tissue; and the innermost layer, the mucous membrane, which is composed of transitional epithelium that runs continuous with the ureters.</para>
  <para id="para-00011">To prevent backflow of urine into the ureters, small flaps of mucosa cover the opening of the ureters into the bladder and act as valves; the internal urethral sphincter, located at the bottom of the bladder, is controlled by the detrusor muscle to control exit of urine through the urethra.</para>
  </section>
  <section id="sect-00008">
  <title>Urethra</title>
  <para id="para-00012">The <term id="term-00025">urethra</term> is a thin-walled, hollow tube-like duct that allows urine to pass from the bladder to the outside of the body. The urine enters the urethra through the internal urethral sphincter; to exit the urethra, it passes through the final controlled muscle, the external urethral sphincter, which is composed of striated muscle fibers. The urethra’s layers include the fibroelastic connective tissue layer (outer layer), smooth muscle layer (middle layer), and epithelial spongy submucosa (inner layer).</para>
  </section>
  <section id="sect-00009">
  <title>Adrenal Gland</title>
  <para id="para-00013">Although adrenal glands are not part of the renal system, they are an extremely important accessory gland. One <term id="term-00026">adrenal gland</term>, or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00027">suprarenal gland</term>, sits atop each kidney. These glands release a hormone called <term id="term-00028">aldosterone</term>, which helps to balance the blood pH and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029">fluid balance</term> by signaling the excretion of potassium and the reabsorption of sodium by the kidneys; aldosterone is part of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to help manage blood pressure (Merck Manuals, 2023). The other major role adrenal glands play is in the release of <term id="term-00030">cortisol</term>. Cortisol has several uses in the body such as helping to maintain blood pressure, increase glucose levels, reduce inflammation, and control metabolism. The relationship to the kidneys comes into play when cortisol signals the kidneys to reabsorb specific electrolytes and excrete others based on the function it is trying to accomplish in the body at a given time.</para>

  <section id="sect-00010">
  <title>Assessment of Nutrition and the Function of the Renal System</title>
  <para id="para-00014">Assessment of the renal system starts with collecting subjective data about urinary symptoms the client is experiencing. Assessing for fluid retention, over- or underproduction of urine, and fluid deficit is useful when assessing renal function. Swelling, unexplained weight gain, difficulty breathing, and very clear urine are some symptoms a client might report that are important to the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00031">assessment of the renal system</term>. Additional symptoms might include dysuria (painful or difficult urination) (Urology Care Foundation, 2023), urinary urgency, or urinary frequency. Other information concerning urinary incontinence, passage of urinary stones, color and clarity of urine, retention of urine, and nocturia (nighttime urinary frequency). Objective data collected to validate these subjective findings can include assessment of limb edema, crackles in the lungs, intake and output measurements, and testing of the urine directly.</para>
  <para id="para-00015">After collecting subjective data, the nurse should complete a physical examination of the renal system. This can be done through organ evaluation and measurement of function results. The physical assessment of the organs should begin with the abdominal assessment procedure as described in <link document="m00016">Chapter 4, The Digestive Process</link> with some special considerations to focus on the renal system during this assessment.</para>
  <para id="para-00016">The first step is an inspection of the skin, during which the nurse should examine the color and look for masses, bulging areas, or distention. Skin discoloration may indicate anemia, if pale or cyanotic; a bulging area above the symphysis pubis may indicate urinary retention or a full bladder; and distention may indicate fluid build-up. Next, during auscultation of the abdomen, hyperactive bowel sounds can indicate diarrhea, which can result from hyperkalemia (Cleveland Clinic, 2023a), possibly related to renal issues. During <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00032">palpation</term> of the abdomen, hyperkalemia may manifest as abdominal tenderness; severe skin dryness may mean dehydration; and an overdistended bladder seen through palpation may indicate urinary retention issues. To palpate the right kidney, the nurse should place one hand under the right flank of the client and press downward against the outer edge of the right abdomen to “sandwich” the kidney, which should be smooth and firm (Roscoe, 2022). The left kidney cannot normally be palpated—unless enlarged—due to its location behind the bowel (Roscoe, 2022). <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00033">Abdominal palpation</term> can also identify urinary retention and a full bladder by identifying fluid in an enlarged bladder. During the final step—percussion of the abdomen—a dullness above the symphysis pubis may indicate bladder distension (Maddukuri, 2022b).</para>
  <note class="safety-alert" id="note-00001">
  <title>Contraindications for Deep Palpation</title>
  <para id="para-00017"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00034">Deep palpation</term> is contraindicated in clients with suspected abdominal aortic aneurysm, appendicitis, polycystic kidney disease, kidney transplantation history, or a tender spleen, due to a risk for injury to the client and rupture of organs (Roscoe, 2022).</para>

  <section id="sect-00011">
  <title>Bladder Scanning</title>
  <para id="para-00018"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00035">Bladder scanning</term> is another way to evaluate the bladder and its ability to effectively empty. This scan can assist in determining whether a client is retaining urine, indicated by bladder distention and abdominal fullness and discomfort. Post void residual (PVR) volume can be measured with a bladder scan machine, which is a portable, hand-held, non-invasive, ultrasound device. A wand is placed at the suprapubic area for examination immediately after the client voids and attempts to fully empty their bladder (Ballstaedt &amp; Woodbury, 2022). Results help to determine if the bladder is being emptied adequately during <term id="term-00036">micturition</term>, or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00037">urination</term>; determine if urine is being produced in those with renal illness; and assess for any bladder tumors, diverticula, or stones that may be present. For young and middle-aged adults (ages 18-65 years), a PVR of less than 50 mL is considered normal, over 200 mL is considered inadequate; for older adults (over age 65), 50 to 100 mL is considered normal; and for children, more than 20 mL is considered abnormal. A PVR over 500 mL, combined with identified neurologic findings, is highly predictive of cauda equina syndrome, a dysfunction affecting the multiple lumbar and sacral nerve roots of the cauda equina, which can cause a need to strain or an altered flow or altered awareness of the need to urinate.</para>
  <note class="safety-alert" id="note-00002">
  <title>Bladder Scanning</title>
  <para id="para-00019">Bladder scanning is not suitable on clients who are pregnant, those with uterine prolapse, or those with severe abdominal scarring and abdominal ascites because these conditions may prompt false high results (Ballstaedt &amp; Woodbury, 2022).</para>

  <title>Other Body Assessments</title>
  <para id="para-00020">In assessing the renal system, the nurse should examine the chest, skin, <term id="term-00038">costovertebral angle</term> (the area on the back flank at the bottom of the 12th rib forming a 90-degree angle to the spine, as shown in (<link target-id="fig-00004" document="m00067"/>), rectum, groin and genitals, and neurologic system. In examining these areas, the nurse should:</para>

  <section id="sect-00013">
  <title>Glomerular Filtration Rate, Serum Creatinine, and Blood Urea Nitrogen Tests</title>
  <para id="para-00021">In addition to physical assessment, several pertinent tests are used to determine the proper functioning of the renal system and are the true indicators of health. The three major serum tests are the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00039">glomerular filtration rate (GFR)</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00040">serum creatinine</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00041">blood urea nitrogen (BUN)</term> (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022; National Kidney Foundation, n.d.). The GFR measures how well the kidneys remove excess fluids and waste products from the blood (factoring in age and sex). This test is related to the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00042">24-hour creatinine clearance test</term>, because it can also identify how well the kidneys filter out wastes. The GFR can be used to evaluate the client for acute kidney injury (AKI) as well as to determine the stage of CKD and when the kidneys have failed completely, requiring transplantation or dialysis. Normal GFR for adults (18–69 years) is above 90 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>; adults (70 years and older) should be greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>; and newborn to two years should be 40 to 60<sup> </sup>mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (Mitchell, Strafford, &amp; Tavares, 2022; National Kidney Foundation, 2023a).</para>
  <para id="para-00022">Serum creatinine is a measurement of the waste product from muscle energy consumption and muscle damage from the kidneys, whereas BUN is a waste product that comes from ingested proteins excreted by the kidneys. Serum creatinine levels should be 0.74 to 1.35 mg/dL for men 19 years and older, 0.59 to 1.04 mg/dL for women 19 years and older, and 0.5 to 1.0 mg/dL for children aged 2 to18 years. Normal BUN levels for all ages are 6 to 24 mg/dL.</para>
  </section>
  <section id="sect-00014">
  <title>Urine</title>
  <para id="para-00023">Testing urine can indicate how well the renal system maintains <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00043">fluid balance</term> by measuring hydration status and volume produced. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00044">24-hour creatinine clearance test</term> measures the amount of creatinine excreted directly into the urine and is conducted through a urine sample collection process completed over 24 hours (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022; National Kidney Foundation, n.d.). If the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00045">creatinine clearance</term> amount is low, then the kidneys are not filtering properly. A full urinalysis can test for pH, sodium, potassium, urea, creatinine, uric acid, phosphorus, calcium, chloride, ammonia, water, ketones, nitrites, blood, glucose, protein, and leukocytes to evaluate for infection and renal damage (Mitchell, Strafford, &amp; Tavares, 2022). Most often, a urine dipstick urine test is used, which can test for blood, urine specific gravity, urine pH, glucose, protein, nitrates, and leukocytes (Mitchell, Strafford, &amp; Tavares, 2022). A more specific dipstick <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00046">urinalysis</term> test, the albumin dipstick test, checks for microalbuminuria that is caused by smaller protein amounts than the standard urine dipstick test can detect. This test can help identify kidney disease in clients who have a negative test for excess protein in the urine in the regular urinalysis testing but who are at high risk for kidney disease (National Kidney Foundation, n.d.). Another specific urine test is the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00047">albumin-to-creatinine-ratio</term> that uses the amount of albumin and creatinine levels to form a ratio, which indicates the level of kidney function.</para>
  </section>
  <section id="sect-00015">
  <title>Image and Biopsy Tests</title>
  <para id="para-00024">Imaging tests—such as ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scans—and biopsies can also be conducted to monitor the function of the kidneys. An ultrasound image of the kidneys can identify obstructions in the urinary tract and evaluate the size and position of the kidneys. A CT scan of the kidneys can help identify obstructions, structural abnormalities (National Kidney Foundation, n.d.), and kidney disease, which would present as abscesses, masses, cystic masses, blockages, or lesions. A kidney biopsy is conducted by taking a sample of the kidney tissue, usually through CT-guided or ultrasound-guided sharp needle aspiration. The tissue sample is then evaluated under the microscope for irregularities like inflammation, protein deposits, or damage, such as scarring or cancerous anomalies (National Kidney Foundation, 2023b). </para>

  <title>Serum Electrolyte Testing</title>
  <para id="para-00025"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00048">Serum electrolyte testing</term> monitors <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00049">fluid balance</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00050">electrolyte levels</term>, both of which are regulated by the kidneys. Irregular values can indicate issues with function. The major electrolytes—sodium, potassium, calcium, and phosphorus— are monitored; however, bicarbonate, chloride, and magnesium are also important indicators of kidney function. This list describes the importance of monitoring these nutrients:</para>
  <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00003">
  <item>Sodium plays a significant role in maintaining fluid and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00051">acid-base balance</term> and is primarily regulated by the kidneys. If the kidneys are not functioning properly, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00052">sodium</term> values can be impacted (Newman, 2023).</item>
  <item><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00053">Potassium</term>, primarily regulated by the kidneys, is an important electrolyte to monitor because minor deviations can cause a client to experience life-threatening problems such as cardiac dysrhythmias, also known as an irregular heartbeat.</item>
  <item>Calcium and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00054">phosphorus</term> have an inverse relationship—when one is high, the other is low. Calcium is extremely important to body functions and the musculoskeletal system. If calcium levels get too low, bone structure can break down and be life threatening for a client who has renal disease. Although <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00055">calcium</term> is not excreted through the kidneys, increased phosphorus levels is a common issue in real failure. Phosphorus levels must be restricted to prevent renal failure as well as to prevent low calcium levels.</item>
  <item>Although the kidneys regulate <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00056">bicarbonate</term> levels, they are not as easily attributed to kidney function—other pathologies in the body and compensatory mechanisms can impact these levels.</item>
  <item>Chloride is excreted and reabsorbed, along with sodium, from the blood. It is, however, found in higher amounts in interstitial compartments and lymph fluid than in the blood, so monitoring sodium is more important than monitoring <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00057">chloride</term> for fluid balance because most of these storage areas cannot be measured.</item>
  <item>Magnesium plays an important role when renal failure is present because excessive intake can lead to hypermagnesemia and can exacerbate or cause hypocalcemia. Regular functioning kidneys remove excess <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00058">magnesium</term>, but in the case of failure and an inability to filter, hypocalcemia can become a serious issue leading to <term id="term-00059">renal bone dysplasia</term>, a life-threatening condition in which the body breaks down the bones to increase blood calcium levels by releasing the calcium stored in bones.</item>

  <title>Analysis of Nutrition and the Renal System</title>
  <para id="para-00027">Subjective and objective data should be collected, as previously discussed, to evaluate abnormal findings and the possibility of malfunction in the renal system. The nurse should complete an analysis of the client’s nutritional status through the client’s lab values and all assessment findings. A baseline of the renal system should then be established and used to develop a nutritional plan.</para>
  <para id="para-00028">When assessing the client, the nurse should ask about dysuria (Urology Care Foundation, 2023), urinary urgency, urinary frequency, urinary incontinence, passage of renal stones, color and clarity of urine, retention of urine, and any issues with nocturia. These findings can indicate several pathologies, including <term id="term-00061">cystitis</term> (inflammation of the bladder caused by infection from bacteria). Cystitis is commonly referred to as a urinary tract infection (UTI). Dysuria can also be related to <term id="term-00062">pyelonephritis</term>, an infection of the upper urinary tract that involves the parenchyma and kidney pelvis. Pyelonephritis is also a UTI, but it is more serious and is usually accompanied by fever, flank pain, nausea and vomiting, hematuria, and suprapubic tenderness, all of which can be subjective data that is also objectively verifiable.</para>
  <para id="para-00029">A report of nocturia, oliguria (low urine output), or anuria (absent urine output) with foamy quality urine can be related to CKD. CKD will very often include many other subjective complaints and be verifiable by objective data as well. Other assessment data that could indicate CKD include lethargy, fatigue, headache, breathlessness, edema, symptoms relating to anemia, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, cramping muscles, <term id="term-00063">hematuria</term> (blood in the urine), and <term id="term-00064">pruritis</term> (uncomfortable itching). Findings of colicky pain, hematuria, nausea, and vomiting can be an indication of renal lithiasis, or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00065">kidney stones</term>. Discharge from the penis or vagina, dysuria, frequency, and purulent drainage from the penis all can be indicative of sexually transmitted infection.</para>
  <para id="para-00030">When physical assessment findings indicate potential pathologies in the renal system, testing can assist in diagnosing the issue. GFR will indicate if there is a decrease in the function of the kidneys when the results are less than normal. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00066">Serum creatinine</term> should be tested with the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00067">BUN</term> results to evaluate kidney function. If the creatinine is high and the BUN is high, kidney functioning is insufficient. <link target-id="table-00001" document="m00067"/> lists laboratory tests typically performed to evaluate possible renal system issues and their relationship to the renal system.</para>
