<title>Nutritional Requirement for Optimal Neurological Health</title>
<para id="para-00002">Although the development of neurologic conditions varies in process, there are several common threads in reduced cognition and other neurologic functions. Neurologic chronic conditions are associated with a variety of factors, such as increased <term id="term-00001">oxidative stress</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">neuroinflammation</term>, and a disruption in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">energy metabolism</term>. Each of these factors can be influenced and modified by dietary intake.</para>
<para id="para-00003">The nurse should screen all clients with neurologic illness for malnutrition in conjunction with the health care team, using the tools described in <link document="m00021">Applying Clinical Judgment to Promote Nutrition for Neurological Wellness</link>. This screening is especially important because clients with neurological conditions may have difficulty <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">chewing</term> or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">swallowing</term>. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">Aphasia</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">apraxia</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">depression</term>, or altered cognitive states may further challenge adequate intake. Key nutritional recommendations for preventing neurologic deterioration in neurodegenerative conditions are provided in this section.</para>
<para id="para-00004">The effect of specific diets (such as ketogenic and Mediterranean diet) among clients with neurologic conditions, such as epilepsy, traumatic and atraumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis, autism, and various neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), have been explored in various clinical trials and are described in this section. While the type of diet is important, it is fundamental that the nurse assess the client’s physical ability to eat. The nurse should assess the client’s current food intake, signs of fatigue, loss of movement, and evidence of dry mouth as these findings can make eating challenging. Meeting the nutritional requirements of clients who have difficulty swallowing (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">dysphagia</term>) secondary to a stroke or other condition can be particularly challenging because these clients require additional diet modifications so that foods can be consumed safely to decrease the risk for choking or aspiration.</para>
<para id="para-00005">Meeting the nutritional requirements of clients with a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">stroke</term> can be challenging, given the potential for difficulty swallowing (dysphagia). Although the ideal diet for a client who has had a stroke is generally similar to a cardiac diet (low salt, low fat, high fiber), this may be challenging.</para>
<section id="sect-00004">
<title>Ketogenic Diet</title>
<para id="para-00006">The <term id="term-00012">ketogenic diet</term> is high in fat and low in carbohydrates, and has been used to facilitate treatment for clients with <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">drug-resistant epilepsy</term>. The impact of the ketogenic diet, as well as variations like a modified Atkins diet or low glycemic diets is to promote the formation of ketone bodies. The brain uses ketones to generate energy, and this type of diet reduces the magnitude of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">glycolysis</term>. Although the science is still somewhat unclear, it is thought that this generation of ketone bodies alters the metabolism of certain neurotransmitters and improves mitochondrial function in a fashion that reduces <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">oxidative stress</term>, improves <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">mitochondrial function</term>, and activates certain signaling pathways (Francis &amp; Stevenson; Miller, et al., 2020).</para>
<para id="para-00007">The beneficial impact of ketogenic diets in clients with <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">epilepsy</term> is well known to be a reduction in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">seizures</term> that have been previously intractable to drug therapy. In addition, the impact of ketogenic diet in children with epilepsy often includes an improvement in cognitive function and a reduced rate of developmental delays, if initiated very early. However, the impact on cognition may be directly related to the diet or to a brain injury associated with uncontrolled seizures.</para>
<para id="para-00008">The ketogenic diet shows some promise in other conditions as well, such as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020">multiple sclerosis</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00021">autism</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00022">Alzheimer’s disease</term> (Li, 2021). In a study of clients with multiple sclerosis, a ketogenic diet may improve concentration, attention, and memory (Francis &amp; Stevenson, 2018). Although limited data exists due to small sample sizes and difficulty with blinding procedures, a ketogenic diet has been shown to improve autistic behavior, but individual food preferences and the gastrointestinal impact of this diet may impact feasibility (Francis &amp; Stevenson, 2018). The effect of the ketogenic diet is to produce a state of ketosis, and among individuals with Alzheimer’s disease, a modest improvement of cognitive function occurs when ketosis is achieved. However, among individuals with Alzheimer’s disease, cognitive improvement was observed only when clients engaged in a ketogenic diet, achieved ketosis, even among those with severe Alzheimer’s disease (Tabaie, et al., 2022). Among individuals with <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)</term>, a high-fat diet, such as the ketogenic diet, has been shown to slow disease progression, while a calorie-restricted diet has been shown to reduce survival rates (Jiang et al., 2022).</para>

<title>Mediterranean Diet</title>
<para id="para-00009">While the Mediterranean diet (<link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00028"/>) has shown effectiveness in preventing heart disease, the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefit of this diet can help prevent stroke events and slow cognitive decline in clients with Alzheimer’s disease, in part because of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00025">long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids</term> and olive oil. Moreover, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00026">polyphenols</term> obtained from fresh fruits and vegetables have been shown to mitigate the phosphorylation of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00027">tau protein</term>, preventing tangle formation, and to negate <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">beta-amyloid aggregation</term> in the brain. The net effect of reducing oxidative stress and neuroinflammation is to enhance <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029">neurogenesis</term>, improve transmission across synapses, and reduce neuronal death (Román et al., 2019).</para>

<title>Alternative Food and Supplement Options</title>
<para id="para-00010">While the ketogenic and Mediterranean diets have shown promise in the prevention and management of neurologic conditions, the metabolism of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00030">lipids</term> in the brain are dramatically disrupted when there is an excessive intake of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00031">carbohydrates</term>, particularly those found in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00032">processed foods</term> such as high-fructose corn syrup and artificial sweeteners. However, complex carbohydrates, such as those found in fresh fruit, vegetables, and high-fiber cereal grains, are recommended for the management of cognitive decline (Román et al., 2019).</para>

<title>Client Teaching</title>
<para id="para-00011">In general, a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, fish, meats, eggs, dairy products, healthy fats (olive oil, avocado, coconut, and flaxseed oils), and probiotic-rich foods (yogurt, kimchi, kefir, sauerkraut), as well as fresh herbs and spices are neuroprotective.</para>
<para id="para-00012">For clients with neurologic conditions, preventing further brain inflammation can mitigate or slow degenerative processes. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00033">Resveratrol</term> is a polyphenolic compound that is present in grapes, mulberries, tea, seeds, some cereals, and red wine consumed in moderation. It can protect the body from developing increased levels of triglycerides and cholesterol and can have a positive effect in the early stages of neurodegenerative disorders (Oppedisano et al., 2020).</para>
<para id="para-00013">Ensuring optimal intake or supplementation of vitamins and certain minerals, such as magnesium, can prevent acute episodes of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00034">brain fog</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00035">fatigue</term> in persons with <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00036">multiple sclerosis (MS)</term>. When supplementing clients with deficiency of vitamins A, B<sub>12</sub>, and D<sub>3</sub>, it is helpful to administer these supplements with <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00037">magnesium</term>, as they do not compete with one another during for absorption. Reducing carbohydrate intake can also help to mitigate the fatigue of MS. <term id="term-00038">Coenzyme Q10</term> (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00039">CoQ10</term>) has been shown to have a significant antioxidant effect to produce energy and is well known for the prevention of heart disease, but it also has neuroprotective effects. CoQ10 is not available in foods but is synthesized by the body. In clients who have experienced <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00040">ataxia</term> because of neurologic conditions, supplementation of CoQ10 has been shown to improve both <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00041">gait</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00042">posture</term> (Oppedisano et al., 2020).</para>
<para id="para-00014">A diet high in antioxidants and fiber can help fight <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00043">inflammation</term> in clients with MS and will slow further demyelination and prevent constipation. Some sources suggest that a ketogenic diet prevents or slows symptom to manifest in clients with MS (Dynka et al., 2022).</para>
