    <para id="para-00002">The islets of Langerhans are clusters of cells located in the pancreas. They are composed of alpha and beta cells, which are crucial for glucose homeostasis. Alpha (α) cells produce glucagon, which breaks down glycogen into glucose in the liver. Beta (β) cells secrete insulin, which regulates glucose metabolism and facilitates absorption of glucose from the bloodstream into cells (see <link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00413"/> Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease that is characterized by hyperglycemia associated with alterations in carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism (Dilworth et al., 2021).</para>

    <media alt="The anatomy of the pancreas. The left, larger side of the pancreas is seated within the curve of the duodenum of the small intestine. The smaller, rightmost tip of the pancreas is located near the spleen. The splenic artery is seen traveling to the spleen. However, it has several branches connecting to the pancreas. An interior view of the pancreas shows that the pancreatic duct is a large tube running through the center of the pancreas. It branches throughout its length into several horseshoe-shaped pockets of acinar cells. These cells secrete digestive enzymes, which travel down the bile duct and into the small intestine. There are also small pancreatic islets scattered throughout the pancreas. The pancreatic islets secrete the pancreatic hormones insulin and glucagon into the splenic artery."><image mime-type="image/png" src="../../media/PHA_Figure_28_01_002.png"/></media>

    <title>Type 1 Diabetes</title>
    <para id="para-00003"><term id="term-00001">Type 1 diabetes</term> is an autoimmune disorder that causes the body’s immune system to attack and destroy the β cells in the pancreas that make insulin. As a consequence, the pancreas stops making insulin. Without insulin, glucose homeostasis is disrupted, resulting in glucose not being able to get into the cells of the body, thus causing elevated glucose levels in the blood. Because the body is destroying the β cells in the pancreas, clients with type 1 diabetes will need to take insulin for the rest of their lives to survive (Holt et al., 2021).</para>

    <para id="para-00006">According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (n.d.-a.), 1.6 million U.S. adults aged 20 years or older have type 1 diabetes. The onset of symptoms with type 1 diabetes is often sudden. It typically appears in adolescents and young adults but can occur in childhood as well. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes can be severe, and the disease process can be difficult to control. Risk factors include family history and age. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">White people</term> are more likely to develop type 1 diabetes than <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">Black</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">Asian American</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">Hispanic</term>, or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">Latino/Latina</term> people (CDC, 2022b).</para>

    <title>Type 2 Diabetes</title>
    <para id="para-00007"><term id="term-00008">Type 2 diabetes</term> occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, or the body is not using insulin effectively. <link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00413"/> shows the mechanism of normal blood sugar absorption versus insulin resistance with type 2 diabetes. The β cells in the pancreas continue to have some degree of functionality with varying amounts of insulin secretion, resulting in elevated blood glucose levels and insulin resistance. Type 2 diabetes may be managed with healthy eating and being active, or the healthcare provider may prescribe insulin, other injectable medications, or oral diabetic medicines to help clients manage blood sugar and avoid complications (CDC, n.d.-b.).</para>
    <para id="para-00008">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (n.d.-b.) reported that of the approximately 37 million U.S. adults who have diabetes, approximately 90%–95% of them have type 2 diabetes. Unlike type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes symptoms are gradual in onset. The disease typically appears in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">people over age 45</term>; however, it is becoming more common in children, adolescents, and young adults.

    <title>Gestational Diabetes</title>
    <para id="para-00009">Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that can develop during pregnancy in clients who do not already have diabetes. Testing for <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">gestational diabetes</term> usually occurs between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy (NIH, n.d.). Gestational diabetes causes high blood glucose levels that can affect the pregnancy and the fetus. Symptoms are usually unnoticeable; however, the client may exhibit signs of increased thirst and increased urination. Gestational diabetes is controlled with dietary management and exercise. Pharmacologic methods are incorporated only if the disease process is unmanageable with diet and exercise and only introduced if safe for both the mother and the fetus. Blood sugar levels typically return to baseline soon after the delivery of the baby. Clients with gestational diabetes are at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes as they age (American Diabetes Association, n.d.-a.).</para>

    <title>Hypoglycemia</title>
    <para id="para-00013"><term id="term-00016">Hypoglycemia</term> occurs when the blood glucose level in the body falls below the normal range. The expected values for normal fasting blood glucose concentration are between 70 mg/dL and 100 mg/dL (WHO, n.d.). When blood glucose levels are too low, the brain does not get enough glucose to function, which in its most severe form can cause coma and death. Signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia include feeling shaky, sweating/chills, clammy skin, dizziness/feeling faint, agitation, confusion, blurred or impaired vision, slurred speech, and tachycardia/bradycardia (American Diabetes Association, n.d.-c.). </para>
    <para id="para-00014">Treatment of hypoglycemia includes the “15–15 rule”: 15 grams of carbohydrates to raise the blood glucose level and a blood glucose monitoring check 15 minutes after administration of the carbohydrates. If the blood glucose level remains under 70 mg/dL, then <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">glucose tablets</term> or 15 grams of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">carbohydrates</term> may be repeated until the blood glucose is at least 70 mg/dL. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">Glucagon</term> may be used to treat clients with diabetes when their blood glucose is too low to treat using the 15–15 rule (American Diabetes Association, n.d.-c.). Glucagon can be given intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously if the client is unable to eat or drink, or if the client is unconscious.</para>

    <section id="sect-00009">
    <title>Hyperglycemia</title>
    <para id="para-00015"><term id="term-00020">Hyperglycemia</term> occurs when the blood glucose level in the body is above the normal range and the body has too little insulin or is too insulin resistant to lower the blood glucose level on its own. This causes a disruption in glucose homeostasis. If a blood glucose level is above 110 mg/dL, it is considered hyperglycemia. Symptoms vary per individual. Some clients may have mild symptoms with blood glucose levels between 110 mg/dL and 240 mg/dL. Severe symptoms can result in diabetic <term id="term-00021">ketoacidosis</term>, coma, and death. Signs and symptoms of hyperglycemia include frequent urination (<term id="term-00022">polyuria</term>), increased thirst (<term id="term-00023">polydipsia</term>), increased hunger (<term id="term-00024">polyphagia</term>), blurred vision, restlessness, unintentional weight loss, abdominal pain, vomiting, drowsiness, hot/dry skin, hypotension, and coma (American Diabetes Association, n.d.-b.; Sapra &amp; Bhandari, 2023).</para>
    <para id="para-00016">Treatment of hyperglycemia can be as simple as dietary management and exercise if blood glucose levels are 110–240 mg/dL. However, if increasing fluid intake, diet, and exercise do not lower blood glucose levels, the individual will require an oral diabetes agent, insulin, and/or a non-insulin injectable drug to lower the blood glucose levels (American Diabetes Association, n.d.-b.; Feingold, 2022).</para>

It determines the amount of hemoglobin proteins that are coated with glucose. A HbA1c below 5.7% is normal. A HbA1c between 5.7% and 6.4% represents prediabetes, and a level of 6.5% or higher indicates diabetes (American Diabetes Association, n.d.-a.).</para>

He or she is at higher risk for developing type 2 diabetes and other serious health problems, including heart disease and stroke” (Alvarez et al., 2023). To better address the growing numbers and problems associated with prediabetes and diabetes, U.S. Congress authorized the CDC to implement the National Diabetes Prevention Program. This program provides individuals with guidance regarding diabetes and lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and to better manage the disease process for those who already have type 2 diabetes.</para>
