    <para id="para-00002">Working with the Community/Public Health Nursing Competencies as a guide, nurses in this specialty make a significant impact on the health of populations. Public/community health nurses collaborate with clinicians across the care continuum to bridge the gap between care that is offered or available and care that is needed or accessed. Health promotion and education, social prescribing, community assessments, advocacy, and disease and disaster response are several examples of essential public/community health nursing interventions that promote and protect the health of community members.</para>

    <title>Interface of Public Health with Nursing Care</title>
    <para id="para-00003">Public health and clinical care can interact on a daily basis to support health across populations of clients. Some interactions are more visible than others, such as during times of a global pandemic. Despite increases in the visibility of and focus on public health during the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">COVID-19</term> pandemic, collaborations between public health and clinical care have been longstanding and ongoing. Such collaborations support both communicable and noncommunicable health concerns.</para>
    <para id="para-00004">During the COVID-19 pandemic, public health efforts such as global, national, county, or city-specific disease surveillance and reporting played a crucial role in guiding clinical care decisions. Such efforts helped hospitals and other care facilities predict the need for services, directed policies on physical distancing and whether businesses and other community centers were open to the public, and helped clients and families evaluate the risk of socializing with those from other households. Public health efforts such as requiring masks when in public helped individuals, families, and essential workers avoid spreading or contracting COVID-19 (Boutzoukas et al., 2022; Cowger et al., 2022; Kociolek et al., 2022). Places that implemented public health policies to facilitate distancing, such as mandating <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">quarantine</term> and isolation when ill, school closures, household confinement, and limiting social gatherings, coincided with fewer COVID-19 cases and lower disease transmission rates than in places that did not implement such procedures early or stringently (Zweig et al., 2021). As public health efforts in prevention, screening, and later <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">vaccination</term> aimed to reduce the clinical care needed across the globe, clinical care efforts were supported by public health initiatives (<link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00117"/>). Clinical care included treatment of active infection, but also testing and diagnosis in established care centers and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">drive-through operations</term>. Public health efforts were also focused on supporting the availability of needed medications, supplies, and equipment to treat active infections in hospitals and homes. Once a vaccine was developed, clinical care included the administration of vaccines. At the same time, public health initiatives determined priority groups for vaccination, established vaccine clinics across communities, and promoted vaccines as a method of health promotion and disease control.</para>

    <para id="para-00005">Infectious disease response and control presents an opportunity for public/community health frameworks to guide clinical care, and for nursing care to support public/community health goals. However, public/community health and nursing care also work in concert to address noncommunicable diseases and health concerns. One key example is addressing the population’s <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">mental health</term> and illness. Mental health impacts people of all genders, races, ages, occupations, parenting status, and education levels, among other innumerable characteristics. In fact, 25% of youth experience depressive symptoms, 35% of adults aged 45 years and older feel lonely, and the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">suicide</term> rate among all nurses is 18% higher than the United States general population, with female nurses having twice the risk of dying by suicide than the general population (Blazer, 2020; Lee and Friese, 2021; Office of the Surgeon General [OSG], 2021). Public health agencies may develop promotional campaigns to reduce the stigma surrounding mental health disorders and educate the public on signs they may observe in themselves or others that indicate help is needed for a mental health concern. Clinicians provide comprehensive mental health care that can include similar education personalized for the client. Public health agencies may work with clinicians to implement standard mental health screening tools into every preventative health encounter and then provide referral sites where other clinicians can offer expert mental health care and counseling. Clinicians may also engage in public health data sharing, making relevant public health agencies and organizations aware of the rates of mental health concerns in a community or nationally. Such sharing supports proper funding of programs to support mental health for all and treat mental illness among affected clients.</para>

    <para id="para-00008">Remember that efforts across clinical and health areas might address <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">upstream</term> or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">downstream</term> factors. As discussed in <link document="m00104">What Is Population Health?</link> upstream factors involve actions and initiatives that address the root causes of health issues, whereas downstream factors include responses to health issues without focusing on solving or preventing the health problem. Thinking about how to create meaningful change in upstream factors as only one nurse can be overwhelming and is much more labor-intensive than, say, teaching a client about the safe administration of medications. Importantly, it is not the responsibility of <emphasis effect="italics">one</emphasis> nurse to change upstream factors or to move an entire health system to a focus on prevention over treatment. Working with individual clients who have diagnosed conditions is, of course, important to their health and quality of life and is a duty of nurses. However, nurses also have a duty to support meaningful upstream change for their clients and the community at large. Nurses can contribute to advancing this area through advocacy and activism, which are detailed in <link document="m00360">Advocating for Population Health</link>. Nurses are well positioned, and have a professional duty, to leverage their personal, social, and political capital (Florell, 2021) as members of a highly trusted profession to engage in nursing activism and advance health equity through upstream change.</para>

    <title>The Role and Significance of the Community Health Nurse</title>
    <para id="para-00009">As frontline clinicians on whom community members rely for health care and guidance, public<emphasis effect="bold">/</emphasis>community health nurses play a crucial role in sharing health information, promoting health through education and counseling, and implementing preventative care activities. Public<emphasis effect="bold">/</emphasis>community health nurses meet the needs of community members seeking health guidance and health care through several key roles and responsibilities. Nurses fulfill several roles that are imperative to supporting a healthy community, such as health promotion and education, social prescribing, community assessments, health advocacy, and disease and disaster response.</para>
    <section id="sect-00005">
    <title>Health Promotion and Education</title>
    <para id="para-00010">Public/community health nurses empower clients, families, and communities through education on health topics and conditions, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">preventative measures</term>, and approaches to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">wellness</term>. For example, nurses in this specialty may teach caregivers of toddlers about nutrient-dense foods that picky eaters may enjoy or hold a weekly learning session to help seniors on a fixed income create recipes based on the local grocery store’s weekly sale flyer. Nurses may employ many methods of teaching, including conducting live and in-person class sessions, holding Zoom meetings, or distributing printed material. Nurses can create their own teaching material informed by current research, best practices, or clinical guidelines, or may access freely available toolkits. Toolkits are often developed by health departments, colleges and universities, or national health organizations. For example, teaching toolkits are available for <link url="https://openstax.org/r/jhforgadmin">HPV vaccination</link>, <link url="https://openstax.org/r/preventionab">substance-use prevention</link>, <link url="https://openstax.org/r/sleepeducation">healthy sleep</link>, <link url="https://openstax.org/r/heartorgenh">hypertension</link>, <link url="https://openstax.org/r/fdanutritioneducati">interpreting nutrition labels</link>, and many other health topics.</para>
    <para id="para-00011">Health promotion efforts also involve screening for conditions and diseases so that the public/community health nurse can make appropriate and early referrals for care. A public/community health nurse may offer vision and hearing <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">screenings</term> each month so community members may be alerted to the need for sensory aids. Preventing diseases before they occur through education and other health promotion activities helps communities reduce disease prevalence, incidence, and impact. This is important for the health of the population, but also decreases the burden and spending on the health care system and resources of the community. In fact, one study of a nurse-led community-based clinic in which clients could receive nonurgent health care and guidance demonstrated a $34 savings to society for every $1 invested (Bicki et al., 2013). While there is some rhetoric regarding the utility and cost of nurse-led clinics, a comprehensive review determined that these clinics do not increase health care costs and have improved client satisfaction with and access to health services (Connolly &amp; Cotter, 2023). Ongoing rigorous research regarding the role of nurse-led initiatives is needed to reach additional conclusions regarding the impact on population health.</para>

    <title>Social Prescribing</title>
    <para id="para-00012"><term id="term-00012">Social prescribing</term> involves referrals to community resources other than those traditionally considered directly related to the health-care setting. Social prescribing is one way to support clients and families with chronic conditions with symptom management and health promotion cost effectively (Husk et al., 2020). Public/community health nurses may facilitate connections to community agencies that support health and social needs, such as financial planning, a walking group, or a community garden (<link target-id="fig-00002" document="m00117"/>). Activities like ballroom dancing, volunteering, seeing plays, or visiting museums can benefit clients’ emotional health, social connectedness, and feelings of empowerment (Chen, 2022). Social prescribing interventions can engage the diverse population in social and health-promoting experiences that also decrease utilization of formal health care services and prevent development of chronic conditions (Howarth et al., 2020). To learn more about this topic, watch the video What is social prescribing?.</para>

    <para id="para-00014">Food insecurity refers to limited or uncertain access to food. Income, employment, race/ethnicity, and disability may all be contributing factors. Neighborhood access to grocery stores impacts food security, given the limited options and higher prices at smaller convenience stores. Additionally, community members without personal cars or access to public transportation to travel to a far-away grocery store can precipitate food insecurity. The Healthy People 2030 program aims to reduce household food insecurity and hunger, eliminate very low food security in children, and increase the consumption of fruits and vegetables among people ages 2 and older.</para>

These nurses provide immediate, on-site care to those affected physically and emotionally by disasters. They also coordinate resources, connect community members to needed resources, and support those affected in efforts to rebuild or return to predisaster levels of functioning. Importantly, public/community health nurses collaborate with public services (e.g., police and fire) to develop plans for responding to disasters in the community. Addressing disasters and engaging in disaster planning helps the public/community health nurse build community resilience. Through building confidence in the community’s ability to respond to a disaster, creating networks of support, and expertly managing health needs in an evolving situation, public/community health nurses minimize the negative health impact of actual or potential disasters.</para>

    <para id="para-00029">Public/community health nurses may work in specialty roles as school nurses, street nurses, occupational health nurses, home care nurses, correctional nurses, or clinic nurses. <link document="m00338">Caring Across Practice Settings</link> describes several of these nursing roles. Regardless of the role, setting, or title, nurses in public/community health provide direct-care services, promote health, reduce risk, and prevent disease within communities. They apply the nursing process throughout their work to identify the community’s health needs, create and disseminate interventions, engage in advocacy efforts, and collaborate with community members and stakeholders to support the overall health of the community. Essentially, these nurses provide the actual care and services that support population health goals in the community and to its members.</para>
    <para id="para-00030">Please note that the term “community nurse” may have a different meaning globally. For example, outside of the United States “community nurse” or “district nurse” may be terms reserved only for nurses who provide direct care in client homes.</para>
    <para id="para-00031">Public/community health nurses apply a community-focused lens to their professional practice. This lens provides a broader view of health and captures more of the community members in the professional efforts of public/community health nurses. Their work will involve promoting public health practices and preventing disease among large groups, such as those in schools, prisons, or community care centers. Please see <link target-id="table-00004" document="m00117"/> for examples of public/community health nurse care settings and nursing actions performed.

    <para id="para-00032">While the community is the client, individuals and families can be recipients of care. Their work will also involve provision of direct care to individuals and families outside of acute-care centers, such as in personal homes and clinics. Individuals and families may need direct nursing care and support to address their conditions and personalized health concerns. Public/community health nurses help individuals and families learn to manage conditions and can administer ordered care and treatments.</para>
    <para id="para-00033">When a public/community health nurse cares for a client, family, or group, the benefits of such care extend to the community at large. The individual or family will benefit from direct nursing care; however, the community at large can also appreciate reductions in communicable diseases, amelioration of health-care disparities, lowered health-care costs, and other benefits to health. In fact, to address health needs in the community, public/community health nurses may mobilize existing resources or develop new programs that will benefit clients and families from across the community. Public/community health nurses work with community members to determine their health priorities and align programs and initiatives with the community’s needs. Determining what to do or which health conditions to address or work toward preventing requires analysis of community member input and community-level health data.</para>
