<title>Concepts Related to Sex and Gender</title>
<para id="para-00003">The terms <emphasis effect="italics">sex</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">gender</emphasis> are sometimes used interchangeably. While they are interrelated terms, they have distinct differences. <term id="term-00001">Sex</term> refers to the physiological and biological characteristics of males and females. <term id="term-00002">Gender</term> refers to male and female characteristics that are socially constructed (World Health Organization [WHO], 2023). <term id="term-00003">Gender identity</term> refers to a person’s internal experience and belief of gender, which may or may not correspond to their physiology or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">designated sex at birth</term> (WHO, 2023). <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">LGBTQIA+</term> is used to refer collectively to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">lesbian</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">gay</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">bisexual</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">transgender</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">queer/questioning</term>, intersex, asexual/aromantic/agender, and other related groups, although the use of terms to describe this population is fluid and changes.</para>
<para id="para-00004">Physical differences can result in the development of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">sex-specific conditions</term>. For example, each sex has a different reproductive system and corresponding reproductive diseases. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">Gender health disparities</term> appear to encompass both sex and gender characteristics as biological, psychological, and social mechanisms intertwine to affect health outcomes in those with long-term disabling conditions (Thakral et al., 2019).</para>

<title>Gender Differences</title>
<para id="para-00006"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">Gender norms</term> are social and cultural principles that influence ideas on how different genders are supposed to behave in society. Such norms are often harmful. For example, gender <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">stereotypes</term>, or generalized preconceptions about what roles or traits should be performed by men and women, often limit their potential and create inequality. Society may also assign rank or status according to gender (i.e., men have a higher standing than women), which causes inequalities between genders that intersect with other social and economic inequalities. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">Discrimination</term> based on gender often crosses, or intersects, with other societal factors such as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">ethnicity</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">disability</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">socioeconomic status</term>, age, geographic location, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">gender identity</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020">sexual orientation</term> (WHO, 2023). This is known as <term id="term-00021">intersectionality</term>, a concept that considers how multiple disadvantages can interact with clients individually and reflect the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00022">inequities</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00023">injustices</term> at the systems level. Sexism, racism, classism, colonialism, heterosexism, and ableism are a few of the structures that result in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">systems-level oppression</term> and privilege (Crenshaw, 1991).</para>
<para id="para-00007">Globally, gender norms negatively affect girls and women more than boys and men (Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights [OHCHR], 2023). For example, over 575 million girls reside in countries where their basic rights related to education, health, and safety are violated as a consequence of inequitable gender norms (Save the Children, 2023). According to the OHCHR, gender stereotypes and discrimination, intersecting with other social and economic stereotypes, are particularly detrimental to women from minority or Indigenous groups, women with disabilities, women from lower caste groups or with lower economic status, and migrant women (OHCHR, 2023).</para>
<para id="para-00008">Boys and men may also be negatively affected by gender norms, particularly those that emphasize rigid notions of masculinity. For example, some gender norms may encourage young men to engage in risky practices such as smoking, unprotected sexual behavior, and alcohol use and abuse, and it may make them less likely than women to seek medical attention (WHO, 2023). Some conceptions of masculinity lead males to commit violence against women and make men subject to violence perpetrated by other men. These pressures may lead some individuals to develop <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00025">mental health</term> issues (WHO, 2023).</para>
<para id="para-00009">Individuals who identify as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00026">gender diverse</term> or transgender also experience negative consequences related to gender. Gender-diverse individuals do not conform to conventional gender norms of being a man or a woman, or they may not “place themselves in the male/female binary” (OHCHR, 2023, para 1). Individuals who are transgender identify with a different sex than the one assigned to them at birth. Globally, both groups experience marginalization, exclusion, violence, discrimination, and other human rights violations related to their gender identities (OHCHR, 2023).</para>
<para id="para-00010">Gender affects people’s experiences with and access to health care. How health services are organized and provided may either enable a person’s access to health care services, information, and support or hinder it (WHO, 2023). Women’s health and well-being is placed at risk because of gender inequality and discrimination. Women more frequently face barriers to accessing health information and services than men. Throughout the world, women face restrictions on movement in the health care system, lack of access to decision-making power, low health literacy rates, discriminatory attitudes of communities and health care providers, and a lack of training among health care providers specific to the health care needs and challenges they face (WHO, 2023).</para>
<para id="para-00011">Findings from a recent survey on women’s experiences with the U.S. health care system are consistent with the WHO’s conclusions. For example, 29 percent of U.S. women aged 18–64 who were surveyed reported their doctor dismissed their concerns, and another 15 percent reported their provider did not believe they were telling the truth (Long et al., 2023). Among survey participants aged 40–64, only 35 percent reported their health care provider discussed what to expect with menopause (Long et al., 2023). In another study, researchers used data from the CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to study differences between males' and females’ ability to access medical care for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). They found that women were more likely to report a delay in accessing health care and an inability to see a health care provider or take prescribed medications due to cost than men (Daher et al., 2021).</para>

<title>How the Gender Gap in Clinical Drug Trials Is Affecting Women</title>
<media alt="atoms_isotopes">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://openstax.org/r/gendergap"/>
</media>
<para id="para-00013">Decades ago, the United States took an important step toward addressing gender disparities in medicine. In 1986, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00032">National Institutes of Health (NIH)</term> established a policy requiring that women be included as subjects of clinical research. The following year, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began requiring pharmaceutical companies to demonstrate medication safety and effectiveness by sex, age, and race (Office on Women's Health, 2020). Despite these policy gains, more work is needed; this video offers a glimpse of the impact of the persistent gender gap in today’s clinical drug trials.</para>

<title>Special Considerations for the LGBTQIA+ Population</title>
<para id="para-00014">Research shows that the LGBTQIA+ population experiences poorer health outcomes compared to the cis-heterosexual population. In a systematic review of the literature, Medina-Martinez et al. (2021) found that as compared to the cis-heterosexual population, this community experiences higher rates of mental health problems, substance misuse, and suicide. They also found that certain cancers, including colon, liver, breast, ovarian, and cervical, are more prevalent among lesbian and bisexual women. Gay and bisexual men have higher rates of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, as well as increased rates of anal, prostate, testicular, and colon cancers (Medina-Martinez et al., 2021). Compared with the general population, individuals who are transgender experience a higher prevalence and earlier onset of disabilities, more chronic health conditions, and higher rates of health problems related to HIV/AIDS, substance use, mental illness, and sexual and physical violence (Medina et al., 2021). For children and adolescents who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning, or queer (LGBTQ), the risks of suicidal thoughts and behaviors is higher (AHRQ, 2022).</para>
<para id="para-00015">Along with the disease risks for members of the LGBTQIA+ population, there are the issues of homophobia, stigma, and discrimination regarding their identity (CDC, 2022c). Limited access to culturally appropriate and orientation-appropriate services can hinder treatment. Finally, members of this group may be fearful about talking about their gender identity and sexual orientation. LGBTQIA+ people face barriers when trying to access health care, including negative and discriminatory experiences with health care workers (Medina-Martinez et al., 2021). Transgender people often experience verbal and physical abuse, hostility, and refusal of care during their interactions with the health care system or with individual health care providers (Medina et al., 2021). See <link document="m00326">Caring for Vulnerable Populations and Communities</link> for more information on health care challenges related to the LGBTQIA+ population.</para>
