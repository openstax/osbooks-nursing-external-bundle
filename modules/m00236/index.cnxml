<para id="para-00002"><term id="term-00001">Fluid volume</term> is a critical component of the body’s homeostasis, allowing for proper functioning of numerous physiological processes. Disruptions to fluid volume can occur due to a variety of factors and can have serious consequences if left untreated. Maintaining an appropriate balance of fluids and electrolytes is essential for optimal health.</para>
<section id="sect-00002">
<title>Fluid Volume Introduction</title>
<para id="para-00003">Fluid volume refers to the total amount of fluid present in the body, which includes both intracellular (inside cells) and extracellular (outside cells) fluids. The body is composed of approximately 60 percent water, which is distributed throughout the body in various compartments, including blood vessels, tissues, and organs.</para>
<para id="para-00004">The fluid volume in the body is tightly regulated through a complex system of feedback mechanisms that help to maintain a balance of fluids and electrolytes. These mechanisms, which are discussed in <link document="m00299">Introduction to Homeostasis</link>, help to ensure that the body’s cells receive the appropriate amount of nutrients and oxygen and that waste products are removed efficiently. [link]Figure 5.2[/link] shows how diffusion works across cell membranes to create a balance.</para>
<para id="para-00005">Maintaining, monitoring, and regulating fluid volume in the body is essential for proper bodily functions and an important aspect of medical care, especially when looking at fluid imbalances, which will be discussed in the next section.</para>

<title>Fluid Imbalances</title>
<para id="para-00006">A <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">fluid imbalance</term> occurs when there is an abnormal distribution of fluids between the <term id="term-00003">intracellular fluid (ICF)</term> and the <term id="term-00004">extracellular fluid (ECF)</term> compartments within the body. An abnormal distribution of fluids between the ICF and ECF compartments can disrupt cellular function and result in fluid imbalance in the form of either a deficit or an excess (Brinkman et al., 2023). These fluid imbalances will be discussed in more detail in the subsequent sections.</para>
<para id="para-00007">A fluid imbalance can be caused by a variety of factors including medical conditions, such as kidney and heart disease, medication use, and lifestyle factors, such as diet and exercise.</para>
<para id="para-00008">Treatment for the imbalance typically involves addressing the underlying cause and restoring the balance of fluids and electrolytes in the body. This may include oral or intravenous fluids, electrolyte replacement, and other interventions as necessary.</para>
<section id="sect-00004">
<title>Fluid Volume Deficit</title>
<para id="para-00009"><term id="term-00005">Fluid volume deficit</term>, also known as <term id="term-00006">hypovolemia</term>, is a condition that occurs when there is a decrease in the body’s fluid volume. This can be due to a loss of sodium from the body, decreased fluid intake, or a combination of both. Several conditions and diseases can lead to fluid volume deficit, such as dehydration, diabetes insipidus, and hemorrhage. Certain drugs, including diuretics, blood pressure drugs (e.g., ACE inhibitors or ARBs, which inhibit aldosterone), and laxatives (which increase fluid loss through stools), can lead to hypovolemia (BMJ, 2022; Melendez-Rivera &amp; Anjum, 2022).</para>
<para id="para-00010">Manifestations of fluid volume deficit include:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00002">
<item>Postural dizziness</item>
<item>Fatigue</item>
<item>Confusion</item>
<item>Muscle cramps</item>
<item>Chest pain</item>
<item>Abdominal pain</item>
<item>Postural hypotension</item>
<item>Tachycardia</item>
</list>
<para id="para-00011">The diagnosis of fluid volume deficit involves a comprehensive approach that includes a thorough physical examination, a detailed client history, and laboratory tests such blood chemistry panels, electrolyte panels, complete blood cell counts, and urinalysis.</para>
<para id="para-00012">Treatment of fluid volume deficit involves replenishing fluids and electrolytes through oral rehydration therapy or intravenous (IV) fluid replacement, depending on the severity of the deficit.</para>
</section>
<section id="sect-00005">
<title>Fluid Volume Excess</title>
<para id="para-00013"><term id="term-00007">Fluid volume excess</term>, also known as <term id="term-00008">hypervolemia</term>, is a condition that occurs when there is an abnormal increase in the body’s total fluid volume. This can be due to increased fluid intake, decreased fluid output, or a combination of both. Several conditions and diseases can lead to fluid volume excess, including heart failure, liver disease, and kidney disease (Ekinci et al., 2018). Certain drugs such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids (which can lead to fluid retention by affecting the kidneys’ ability to eliminate sodium and water), hormonal therapies such as estrogen replacement (which can lead to fluid retention), and diabetes drugs such as thiazolidinediones can cause fluid retention as an adverse effect.</para>
<para id="para-00014">Manifestations of fluid volume excess include:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00003">
<item>Shortness of breath</item>
<item>Crackles in the lungs</item>
<item>Swelling in the legs, ankles, and feet</item>
<item>Weight gain</item>
<item>High blood pressure</item>
<item>Fatigue</item>
</list>
<para id="para-00015">To diagnose fluid volume excess, the provider must take a comprehensive approach. This involves a physical examination, a detailed client history, and various laboratory tests such as blood chemistry panels, electrolyte panels, complete blood cell counts, and urinalysis. Additionally, imaging studies like a chest x-ray and echocardiogram may also be necessary to assess the heart and lungs.</para>
<para id="para-00016">Treatment of hypervolemia involves addressing the underlying cause, restricting fluid and sodium intake, and increasing urine output through <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">diuretic drugs</term>. In severe cases, hospitalization may be required for monitoring and treatment.</para>

<title>Fluid Replacement</title>
<para id="para-00017"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">Fluid volume replacement</term> is a medical treatment that involves replenishing lost fluid and electrolytes, specifically sodium in the body, typically through IV infusion. This treatment is commonly used to address fluid volume deficit and conditions that result in body fluid loss.</para>
<para id="para-00018">Fluid volume replacement works by restoring the balance of fluid and electrolytes that are essential for maintaining proper bodily function. Electrolytes are electrically charged minerals such as sodium, potassium, chloride, phosphate, magnesium, and calcium, which play roles in regulating cellular function and maintaining the body’s fluid balance (Melendez-Rivera &amp; Anjum, 2022).</para>
<para id="para-00019">Fluid volume replacement usually involves various types of fluids or a combination of fluids containing electrolytes and other nutrients. The specific type of fluid used depends on the client’s condition and individual needs. Fluid replacement and types of intravenous fluid replacement solutions will be discussed in more detail in subsequent sections.</para>
<para id="para-00020">Fluid volume replacement is administered by health care professionals, and the treatment is closely monitored to ensure that the client’s fluid and electrolyte levels are being properly balanced.</para>

<title>Blood and Blood Products</title>
<para id="para-00021"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">Blood</term> is a vital component of fluid balance. Blood circulates through the body and is composed of various cells including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets (see [link]Figure 5.3[/link]), as well as a liquid component called plasma. Blood plays an important role in:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00004">

<para id="para-00022"><term id="term-00012">Blood products</term> are derived from donated human blood and are used for a variety of medical purposes, including fluid volume replacement. The most commonly used forms of blood products for fluid replacement are packed red blood cells (PRBCs), platelets, plasma, and cryoprecipitated anti-hemophilic factor (cryo) (American Red Cross, n.d.).</para>
<para id="para-00023">When a person experiences severe blood loss or fluid volume deficit, fluid volume replacement is necessary to restore their blood volumes and prevent <term id="term-00013">shock</term>. Blood and blood products are administered intravenously to replenish lost fluids/blood, maintain the body’s blood pressure and hormonal balance, and restore the body’s oxygen-carrying capacity (Lotterman &amp; Sharma, 2022). Blood and blood products will be discussed in more depth in the next section of this chapter.</para>
