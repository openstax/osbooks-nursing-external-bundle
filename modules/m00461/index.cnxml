    <title>Adverse Effects and Contraindications</title>
    <para id="para-00007">Adverse effects are essentially identical for both drugs. Although administering drugs using the ophthalmic route causes minimal systemic effects, they still can occur. The potential exists for prolonged bleeding due to interference with the aggregation (clumping) of thrombocytes (platelets). Blood can enter the aqueous humor, resulting in a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">hyphema</term> (a collection of blood in the anterior chamber of the eye). The blood usually will dissipate on its own over time. In some susceptible clients, such as those with corneal denervation, dry eye syndrome, diabetes mellitus, or rheumatoid arthritis, continued use of topical NSAIDs over 14 days may result in epithelial breakdown, corneal thinning, erosion, ulceration, or perforation. If any of these occur, they can impair vision. Clients who exhibit evidence of corneal epithelial breakdown should immediately discontinue use of the topical NSAIDs and must be closely monitored to ensure proper healing of the cornea.</para>
    <para id="para-00008">All ophthalmic NSAIDs and corticosteroids may slow or delay healing. Concurrent use of these drugs may increase the potential for further healing difficulties. Combining any ophthalmic NSAID with latanoprost will diminish the therapeutic effect of latanoprost.</para>
    <para id="para-00009">Ocular NSAIDs are contraindicated for clients with a history of severe NSAID or acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) hypersensitivity.</para>

    <title>Ocular Immunosuppressants</title>
    <para id="para-00014">In ocular inflammation, immunosuppressants are used as steroid-sparing agents to control the inflammation, with a goal of long-lasting remission and prevention of the threat to vision. Likewise, these agents are utilized to “reprogram” the immune system to alleviate or reduce the lymphocytes from attacking and causing recurrent autoimmune destruction of healthy ocular tissue (Liu et al., 2023). Although several drugs could be used, cyclosporine is the predominant one.</para>
    <para id="para-00015">Systemic immunosuppressants are used in some cases for inflammatory eye diseases because they can prevent potential permanent vision loss. This treatment strategy is deployed often for uveitis and other ocular conditions when other treatments have failed (Kopplin, 2020).</para>
    <section id="sect-00007">
    <title>Adverse Effects and Contraindications</title>
    <para id="para-00016">Because there is minimal systemic absorption, most of the adverse effects are local. Hypersensitivity reactions such as ocular redness, blurry vision, and lid swelling can occur; therefore, the client should be aware and observed for signs of this (College of Optometrists, 2023). It is rare for the drug to cause an anaphylactic reaction.</para>
    <para id="para-00017">No true contraindications exist when giving this drug via the ophthalmic route. If a client is already immunocompromised from a different condition, it is important for them to contact their provider if they begin to experience signs of infection. If topical corticosteroids are given concurrently with cyclosporine, this can increase the chances of infection because both drugs can decrease the immune response.</para>

    <title>Ocular Antibacterials</title>
    <para id="para-00031">Topical antibacterials are used to treat ophthalmic infections and to prevent infection after ocular surgery. Bacterial infections are and will remain contagious until treated for 24–48 hours. There are various antibacterials that have ophthalmic uses. These agents are active against numerous gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. They are generally used to treat infections involving the conjunctiva or cornea, such as conjunctivitis, keratitis, corneal ulcers, and blepharitis. The choice of antibiotic depends on the pathogen causing the infection. Additionally, many different combination preparations are available. Caution should be exercised when administering these products with regard to the select agent, strength, and formulation. Unfortunately, the risk of superinfection is high when using ophthalmic antibiotics due to contamination of the eyedropper or tube. Counseling on the proper technique of administration is a critical teaching point to help reduce the risk of superinfection.</para>
    <para id="para-00032">Various drug classifications are used to treat ocular infections. Some of these include fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin), aminoglycosides (gentamycin, neomycin), macrolides (erythromycin), and a combination drug that includes neomycin. Ocular neomycin can be prescribed in several ways: neomycin, polymyxin B, and bacitracin; neomycin, polymyxin B, and hydrocortisone; neomycin, polymyxin B, and dexamethasone; or neomycin, polymyxin B, and gramicidin. Polymyxin is considered a polypeptide bactericidal antibiotic, while bacitracin is a bactericidal and bacteriostatic polypeptide antibiotic. Dexamethasone and hydrocortisone are corticosteroids (discussed in the previous section). The choice of the medication may depend on many factors. One important factor to consider is whether the client wears contact lenses.</para>
    <section id="sect-00015">
    <title>Gentamicin Sulfate</title>
    <para id="para-00033">Gentamicin sulfate has bactericidal effects that interfere with bacterial synthesis. This class of medication is used primarily against aerobic gram-negative bacilli, such as <emphasis effect="italics">Escherichia coli</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">Klebsiella pneumoniae</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">Proteus mirabilis</emphasis>, and <emphasis effect="italics">Pseudomonas aeruginosa.</emphasis> The drug has no effects on anaerobic bacteria. In addition to the uses of ciprofloxacin, gentamicin can be used for blepharitis, acute meibomianitis (inflammation of the meibomian gland), and dacryocystitis (inflammation of the lacrimal sac) (DailyMed, <emphasis effect="italics">Gentamicin</emphasis>, 2022).</para>
    </section>
    <section id="sect-00016">
    <title>Neomycin Sulfate/Polymyxin B Sulfate/Gramicidin</title>
    <para id="para-00034">This combination antibiotic product has multiple mechanisms of action. First, it works similar to gentamicin by interfering with bacterial synthesis. This drug is mainly used in the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis and blepharitis. Sometimes it is necessary to administer both a corticosteroid and an antibacterial, such as for inflammatory ocular infections or traumas. Even if there is no active infection, corticosteroids reduce the body’s immune response, and if this is clinically concerning based on the client’s health, an antibacterial may be added as a prophylactic measure.</para>
    </section>
    <section id="sect-00017">
    <title>Erythromycin</title>
    <para id="para-00035">This drug is the first-line agent in treating simple cases of bacterial conjunctivitis. It prevents the further growth of bacteria rather than directly destroying them. Interestingly, because this drug is administered via ointment form, even if it stays on the eyelid and eyelashes, it still provides a therapeutic effect despite the medication not being directly on the conjunctiva (DailyMed, <emphasis effect="italics">Erythromycin</emphasis>, 2023).</para>
    <para id="para-00036">In newborns born to someone with active disease, 1 cm of ointment is administered one time right after delivery to prevent eye infections, especially gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum (GON) and chlamydial ophthalmia. If left untreated, these infections can cause serious eye problems, including corneal scarring, ocular perforation, and blindness as early as 24 hours after birth. Erythromycin is the only FDA-approved drug for this purpose.</para>

    <title>Adverse Effects and Contraindications</title>
    <para id="para-00038">Ocular antibacterials can cause blurred vision; therefore, safety factors must be in place to prevent falls (uncluttered environment, adequate lighting, walking devices in reach). Hypersensitivity reactions to these drugs or any of their components can occur even with the first dose, so the nurse must make clients aware of this and tell them to seek treatment immediately. The drug should be discontinued at the first appearance of a skin rash.</para>
    <para id="para-00039">Use of antibacterials over a prolonged period can deplete the normal flora, causing a superinfection. If this occurs, the treatment plan may need to be modified to add an antifungal agent. If the superinfection is bacterial, the overgrowth of this new organism may be resistant to the antibiotic’s activity, and another appropriate antibacterial will need to be initiated.</para>
    <para id="para-00040">Because they have a broad spectrum of activity against multiple organisms, ocular antibacterials are often overused, which can lead to the development of bacterial resistance. If purulent discharge, inflammation, or pain becomes worse, the client should discontinue the drug and contact a health care provider.</para>
    <para id="para-00041">During the first 7 days of treating a corneal ulcer with ciprofloxacin drops, a nonharmful white crystalline precipitate commonly forms on the corneal defect.

    <para id="para-00042">If ciprofloxacin is concurrently given with a systemic fluoroquinolone, arthropathy (tendon inflammation and tendon rupture) can occur. This usually occurs in young and older populations.</para>

Most of the drug adheres to the cornea for desired periods of time without causing secondary damage. This drug does not enter intraocular fluid; therefore, it does not increase eye pressure. Continuation of therapy is determined by clinical picture and laboratory studies.</para>
    <para id="para-00055">It may be helpful to decrease the dosage gradually at 4- to 7-day intervals to ensure the replicating organism has been eliminated. Failure to improve within 10 days indicates that the organism may not be related to a fungus. If true, the organism may be resistant to natamycin, and a different drug may be prescribed.</para>
