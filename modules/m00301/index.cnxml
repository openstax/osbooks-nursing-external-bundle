    <para id="para-00001">The <term id="term-00001">immune system</term> is an intricate defense mechanism that protects the human body from diseases and infection. It uses antibodies and white blood cells to combat foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses. Maintaining a healthy immune system is essential for overall well-being and resilience against potential harm. This section of the chapter will discuss the immune system and its function, explain antigen-antibody interactions, and compare antibody-mediated and cell-mediated immunity.</para>
