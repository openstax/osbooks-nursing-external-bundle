<title>Normal Function of the Endocrine System</title>
<para id="para-00002">The <term id="term-00001">endocrine system</term> is a network of cells, tissues, and organs that regulate and control all processes using <term id="term-00002">hormones</term>. Hormones are secretions that help regulate organ function by exerting their effects on certain cells in the organ. They coordinate biological functions like metabolism, sexual reproduction, blood pressure, body temperature, heart rate, growth, development, and sleeping. Related to nutrition, the endocrine system regulates appetite and how nutrients are used.</para>
<para id="para-00003">The <term id="term-00003">hypothalamus</term> is a region in the brain that regulates the endocrine system  through its connection and coordination with the nervous system. The <term id="term-00004">pituitary gland</term>, also located in the brain<emphasis effect="italics">,</emphasis> regulates other glands like the adrenal, thyroid, and testicles. These glands include the thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal, pineal, and pancreas which play critical roles in regulating calcium levels in the body, metabolism, sexual development, and blood pressure, and insulin production, respectively. <link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00031"/> shows the pituitary gland and other key parts of the endocrine system. The goal of regulating hormone levels in the blood is to reach a state of balance or <term id="term-00005">homeostasis</term>. Imbalances can lead to health problems like high blood pressure, changes in mood and behavior, and weight gain (Betts et al., 2022).</para>

<title>Alterations in Endocrine System Function</title>
<para id="para-00006">Endocrine disorders develop in one of two ways. <term id="term-00013">Primary endocrine disorders</term> result from problems with the peripheral glands, while <term id="term-00014">secondary endocrine disorders</term> result when the pituitary gland is either over or under stimulated by the hypothalamus causing an alteration in the peripheral gland’s function. The result of all endocrine disorders is either hyper-functioning or hypo-functioning of the affected gland.</para>
<section id="sect-00004">
<title>Alterations in Endocrine System Function – Diabetes</title>
<para id="para-00007">The most prevalent endocrine disorder is (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, n.d.). It is estimated that 37.3 million Americans have diabetes, with approximately 8.5 million cases (23%) undiagnosed (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 2023). Diabetes  develops when the body is not able to maintain adequate blood glucose control (Sapra &amp; Bhandari, 2023). <term id="term-00016">Type 1 diabetes</term> typically develops early in life and occurs when insulin producing cells (beta cells) are destroyed in the pancreas resulting in low to non-existent levels of insulin. <term id="term-00017">Type 2 diabetes</term> results from insulin resistance that develops gradually from obesity and aging. The insufficient amount of insulin (type 1 diabetes) and/or functionally ineffective amounts of insulin (type 2 diabetes) result in elevated blood glucose levels.</para>
<para id="para-00008"><term id="term-00018">Glycemic control</term>, which is the maintenance of optimal blood glucose levels, is essential to manage potential complications of diabetes effectively. Poorly controlled blood glucose levels lead to vascular and neurological complications including myocardial infarctions, cerebral vascular accidents, renal disease, neuropathies, and retinopathy (Sapra &amp; Bhandari, 2023). These complications result from several different mechanisms triggered by elevated blood glucose levels that either cause buildup within vessels that impede blood flow, reduce the ability of the vessels to autoregulate, or trigger altered biochemical processes that hinder the vessel’s functionality (Brutsaert, 2022). The risk for these conditions developing is increased in clients who have co-morbid conditions.</para>

<section id="sect-00005">
<title>Alterations in Endocrine System Function – Other Endocrine Disorders</title>
<para id="para-00011">Other endocrine disorders commonly seen are hypo/hyperthyroidism and adrenal disorders. Hypothyroidism results from the decreased levels of <term id="term-00020">thyroid hormones T4 and T3</term>. Accordingly, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is increased, indicating that the thyroid gland is not functioning properly. It usually results from autoimmune causes, but it could also occur after radioactive iodine therapy or surgery for hyperthyroidism or <term id="term-00021">goiter</term> (Braunstein, 2022). Hyperthyroidism is caused by increased secretion of T4 and T3 caused by <term id="term-00022">Graves’ disease</term>, goiter, or thyroiditis. Adrenal insufficiency is caused by <term id="term-00023">Addison’s disease</term> or a disorder regulating the pituitary gland and results in low cortisol levels in the body (Grossman, 2022). In an effort to stimulate the adrenal glands, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is released. Conversely, <term id="term-00024">Cushing’s disease/syndrome</term> develops when corticosteroid levels in the body are high either from taking corticosteroid medications or from overproduction by the adrenal glands.</para>

<title>Assessment of Nutrition and the Function of the Endocrine System</title>

<para id="para-00013">Taking a client’s <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00025">health history</term> is the first step when assessing the client’s endocrine system. In addition to general health history questions, it is important to identify conditions for which the client may be at risk and to assess the need for genetic testing (Bickley et al., 2021). When collecting information on the client’s nutritional status for potential effects on the endocrine system, the nurse should ask about changes in appetite, thirst and fluid intake, and bowel function. It is also important to know if the client has experienced any changes in weight or energy levels.</para>

<title>Analysis of Nutrition and the Endocrine System</title>
<para id="para-00016">The endocrine system requires adequate nutrition to function. Nutritional deficits or imbalances can cause various endocrine abnormalities. For example, the most common cause worldwide for goiter, or an enlarged thyroid (<link target-id="fig-00003" document="m00031"/>), is <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">iodine deficiency</term> as <term id="term-00029">iodized salt</term> is not consistently used worldwide  (Can &amp; Rehman, 2023). However, in the United States, its use has significantly reduced goiter development (Can &amp; Rehman, 2023). Instead, goiter formation in the United States is usually caused by Hashimoto’s thyroiditis or Graves’ disease. Clients who primarily consume other types of salt (kosher, sea, etc.) need to obtain iodine in their diet through other means.</para>
<figure class="scaled-down" id="fig-00003"><media alt="A woman with a goiter, which is an extreme, irregular swelling on the anterior side of the neck."><image mime-type="image/jpg" src="../../media/NUT_Figure_07_01_004.jpg"/></media>
<caption>Iodine deficiencies can lead to goiter, an enlarged thyroid. (credit: “Goitre” by Almazi/ Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)</caption></figure>
<para id="para-00017">A thorough analysis of the client’s nutrition status can help identify potential endocrine-related issues. The nurse should review the nutritional assessment to identify any nutrient-related deficiencies. For example, a client with limited fruit and vegetable consumption is at risk for <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00030">vitamin C deficiency</term>. Vitamin C deficiency is associated with multiple health problems. Specifically related to the endocrine system, vitamin C affects the regulation of several important hormones including insulin growth factor and sex steroids (Shi, Rath, &amp; Niedzwiecki, 2021). Conversely, when evaluating the client’s nutrition status, there is potential to find excessive intake of nutrients. For example, a diet with excessive carbohydrate intake can increase blood glucose levels in individuals contributing to the development of insulin resistance and diabetes. Once nutritional imbalances are identified, the nurse can work with the client to make dietary changes and reduce the risk for developing endocrine disorders (Bickley et al., 2021). <link target-id="table-00003" document="m00031"/> lists signs and symptoms of common endocrine disorders and their corresponding nutritional factors.</para>
