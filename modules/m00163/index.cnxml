<para id="para-00002">Epidemiologists often categorize the amount of a disease present in a community as a specific level of disease: endemic, hyperendemic, sporadic, epidemic, outbreak, or pandemic. Public health officials use this information to assist in planning appropriate interventions. The <term id="term-00001">endemic</term> level is the continual and constant presence of a disease within a geographic area—the observed level in a defined area; it may also be referred to as the usual rate of disease at any given time or the baseline level.</para>
<para id="para-00003">Persistent high levels of disease in a defined area are characterized as <term id="term-00002">hyperendemic</term>. Diseases that occur occasionally at irregular intervals are considered <term id="term-00003">sporadic</term> or infrequent. When the level of disease in a defined area rises above the endemic levels—a sudden increase in the number of cases of a disease above what is normally expected—it is referred to as an <term id="term-00004">epidemic</term>. Both infectious and noninfectious diseases can become epidemics. An <term id="term-00005">outbreak</term> is an epidemic that affects a limited geographic area. A pandemic is a worldwide epidemic. See <link document="m00167">Pandemics and Infectious Disease Outbreaks</link>.</para>

<title>Common Epidemiological Measures</title>
<para id="para-00004">Using epidemiological measures is one way of knowing when there is an excess of what is expected (Celentano &amp; Szklo, 2019). Common <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">frequency</term> measures in epidemiology are ratios, proportions, and rates.</para>
<section id="sect-00003">
<title>Ratios</title>
<para id="para-00005">A <term id="term-00007">ratio</term> is a comparison of any two values, calculated by dividing one interval by the other. The numerator and denominator do not have to be related. After dividing the numerator by the denominator, the result is expressed as the result “to one” or “:1” See <link target-id="note-00001" document="m00163">Calculating Ratios</link> for more detail on the calculation.</para>
<para id="para-00006">Ratios can be used as a descriptive measure, such as describing the man-to-woman ratio of participants in a study. They can also be used in calculations for the occurrence of illness or death between two groups. <term id="term-00008">Death-to-case ratio</term> is used as a measure of illness severity because it refers to the number of deaths attributed to a disease during a specific period of time divided by the number of new cases during the same period. As an example, rabies has a death-to-case ratio of almost 1, meaning that almost everyone who develops it dies from it (CDC, 2012).</para>

<title>Proportions</title>
<para id="para-00021">A <term id="term-00009">proportion</term> is a form of ratio where the numerator represents a subset of the denominator. An example is looking at the percentage of a population that is younger than 18 years. Proportions can be communicated as a decimal, fraction, or percentage. See <link target-id="note-00002" document="m00163">Calculating Proportions</link> for more details on the calculation. Proportions are often used as descriptive measures, such as the proportion of children in a community vaccinated against the flu or the proportion of individuals at a boarding school who developed illness (CDC, 2012). Proportions also describe the extent of disease attributable to a particular exposure. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">Proportionate mortality</term> is the proportion of deaths in a defined population during a defined time period that are attributed to different causes. Each cause is communicated as a percentage of all deaths, where the sum of causes equals 100 percent (CDC, 2012). These proportions are not rates, as the denominator is all deaths.</para>

<title>Rates</title>
<para id="para-00032">In epidemiology, a rate is a measure of how often an event occurs in a specified population over a defined period of time. Rates are useful for comparing disease frequency in different locations, at different times, or among different groups of individuals, often considered a measure of risk (CDC, 2012). Epidemiologists use rates to describe incidence, prevalence, case-fatality, and attack rates. It is important to note that attack rate, prevalence rate, and <term id="term-00011">case-fatality rate</term> are not considered “true” rates by some as they are not expressed in units of time, but these proportions provide valuable information in looking for patterns and using data for comparison (CDC, 2012).</para>
<para id="para-00033"><term id="term-00012">Morbidity</term> is another term for having a disease, illness, or medical condition and includes disease, injury, and disability. Measures of morbidity characterize the number of individuals in a population who become ill or are ill at a specified time. Commonly used measures of morbidity are <term id="term-00013">attack rate</term>, also known as incidence proportion, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">secondary attack rate</term>, <term id="term-00015">incidence rate</term>, point prevalence, and period prevalence. See <link target-id="note-00003" document="m00163">Incidence Rate</link>, <link target-id="note-00004" document="m00163">Prevalence Rate</link>, <link target-id="note-00005" document="m00163">Attack Rate</link>, and <link target-id="note-00006" document="m00163">Case-Fatality Rate</link> for more detailed definitions of these rates. The <term id="term-00016">mortality rate</term> measures the frequency of death in a defined population during a specific time interval. See <link target-id="note-00007" document="m00163">Mortality Rate</link> for more details on the various mortality rates often used.</para>
<note class="boxed-feature" id="note-00003">
<title>Incidence Rate</title>
<para id="para-00035">An incidence rate is a proportion in which the numerator is all new cases of a disease or health condition during a given period of time. The denominator is the population at risk during the same period. Incidence rates describe how quickly a disease or illness occurs in a specified population. Incidence rates of a health condition in a population are often expressed as the incidence rate per 100,000 population.</para>

<title>Measures of Association</title>
<para id="para-00099">Epidemiologists seek to identify <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00021">causal relationships</term> between agents and disease by first assessing whether they are associated. An observed association between an exposure or an agent and a disease may indicate a causal relationship, but it may be a result of an error with the sampling method used (Green et al., 2011). Measures of association, such as relative risk (risk ratio), rate ratio, odds ratio, and attributable risk, assess the degree to which the risk of disease increases when exposed to an agent, thereby demonstrating the strength of an association—or, put another way, the strength of a causal relationship. Measures of association essentially compare disease occurrence among two groups—one being the primary interest group and the other being the comparison group—and serve as epidemiological criteria to establish causal relationships (CDC, 2012).</para>

<title>Attributable Risk</title>
<para id="para-00133">The <term id="term-00028">attributable risk (AR)</term> is an often-used measurement of risk, representing the amount of disease among exposed individuals attributed to the exposure. AR represents the maximum proportion of disease that can be attributed to the exposure and is the maximum proportion of disease that can possibly be prevented by eliminating the exposure (Green et al., 2011). AR can also be stated as the attributable proportion of risk, the proportion of the disease among exposed individuals that is associated with the exposure, and can be used as a measure of the public health impact of a causative factor. It assumes the incidence of disease in the unexposed group is the baseline and expected risk for that disease. It also assumes that if there is a difference between the incidence of disease in the two groups, the difference is due to the exposure. This is an appropriate tool to measure risk when a single risk factor or exposure is being considered but does not work well when there are multiple exposures to various agents.

<title>Sources of Error</title>
<para id="para-00143">While reviewing epidemiological studies, the nurse must assess the strength of associations demonstrated in the study. A source of error can be a positive association discovered between an exposure and a health event when there is no true association. Another potential source of error occurs when no association is found between an exposure and health event when there is an association. A study may also find an association, but the strength of the association is greater or less than the actual association. These types of errors may be a result of chance, bias, or confounding. The nurse has a duty to examine each study for the possibility of these types of errors, which are explained in the following sections.</para>
<section id="sect-00012">
<title>Chance</title>
<para id="para-00144"><term id="term-00029">Chance</term> refers to a random error that may occur within any study. The larger the <term id="term-00030">sample size</term> (the higher the number of participants), the less likelihood of a random error, but a large sample size does not eliminate the risk of a random error (Green et al., 2011). To assess for random error, epidemiologists use <term id="term-00031">statistical significance</term> and confidence intervals to permit an assessment of the study’s risk for random error (Green et al., 2011). Studies with statistically significant results are unlikely to be the result of random error. <term id="term-00032">Confidence intervals</term> provide the relative risk (or other risk measure) found in the study and an interval within which the risk would most likely fall if the study were repeated multiple times. If a 95 percent confidence interval is chosen, the range includes results expected 95 percent of the time if the samples for new studies were continually drawn from the same population.</para>
<para id="para-00145">A <term id="term-00033"><emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis> value</term> represents the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00034">probability</term> that the observed association could be the result of random error (Green et al., 2011). A <emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis> value of 0.2 means there is a 20 percent chance the values found could have occurred by random error with no actual association present. Epidemiologists strive to minimize false positives by using <emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis> values that fall below a selected level—often 0.05—known as <term id="term-00035">alpha</term>, or the significance level, for the results of the study to be statistically significant (Green et al., 2011). The 0.05 alpha level means there is a 5 percent probability that the association found in the study would occur without an actual association, occurring by chance. The outcome will be deemed statistically significant if the observed alpha (<emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis> value) falls below the preselected significance level (Green et al., 2011). Note that the <emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis> value does not give the probability that the risk estimate in the study is correct; similarly, the confidence interval does not provide the range within which the true risk lies.</para>
</section>
<section id="sect-00013">
<title>Bias</title>
<para id="para-00146"><term id="term-00036">Bias</term>, also referred to as a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00037">systematic error</term> (tendency to underestimate or overestimate the value of a parameter), is another source of error in a study’s outcome, arising in the design or conduct of the study, data collection, or data analysis (Green et al., 2011). Researchers attempt to minimize bias through strong data collection protocols and overall study design. Bias results in a non-random error in a study result. When present, it may invalidate the results.</para>
<para id="para-00147">The two common categories of bias are <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00038">selection bias</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00039">information bias</term>. Selection bias results from an inappropriate method of selecting study participants, particularly the control group; the control group should be drawn from the same population as the participants with the health event or health exposure that is under study. Selection bias also occurs when participants decline to participate after agreeing to do so or when they drop out before study completion.</para>
<para id="para-00148">An example of selection bias occurred in a study looking at the effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on coronary heart disease (CHD) in women. Several observational studies demonstrated a decrease in CHD in women using HRT. Later randomized controlled trials found the opposite effect—that HRT may increase the risk for CHD in this population. The difference in the findings was related to selection bias. Among the women in the observational studies, those taking HRT tended to be younger, more health conscious, and more physically active than those who were not using HRT. This resulted in a health-conscious bias as the observational studies represented the usual woman who initiated HRT (Catalogue of Bias Collaboration et al., 2017). Women who participated in the randomized control trials were older, more likely to be overweight or obese, and were using HRT for a much shorter duration than the women in the observational studies (Hodis &amp; Mack, 2022).</para>
<para id="para-00149">Information bias results from a weakness in measuring the exposure or disease in the study group. In particular, in a case-control study, information bias is a consideration because the researcher depends on information from the past to determine exposure and disease and their relationship (Green et al., 2011). Research has demonstrated individuals with disease (cases) recall past exposure better than individuals without disease (control), creating a potential for recall bias. With case-control studies, researchers sometimes need to rely on interviews with surrogates when study subjects have died of the disease under investigation or are not well enough to be interviewed (Green et al., 2011). For example, in a case-control study looking at Alzheimer’s-type dementia, determining past exposures between the case and control groups could lead to information bias. In the cases, clients with Alzheimer’s-type dementia may have difficulty recalling past exposures compared to the control group, clients without Alzheimer’s-type dementia. Due to this recall bias, the presence of potential exposures as risk factors may be underreported in the case group, resulting in the researchers miscalculating the importance of these potential risk factors in disease development.</para>

<title>Confounding</title>
<para id="para-00150"><term id="term-00040">Confounding</term> is another type of error that may result in an incorrect causation or conclusion. This occurs when another factor (the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00041">confounder</term>) is mistakenly identified as the agent associated with the outcome (Green et al., 2011). Confounding occurs when a confounder is both a risk factor for the disease and a factor associated with the exposure being investigated. This may result in an incorrect conclusion about causation, since the misidentified agent is not the true causal factor (Green et al., 2011). Confounding can be more of an issue with observational studies because in observational studies the participants are not assigned randomly to the comparison groups. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00042">Randomization</term> helps to ensure that exposures, outside of the one being investigated, are evenly distributed between groups. Other techniques to limit confounding occur in the design stage with appropriate and thoughtful methods for selecting participants. If factors of age, gender, or certain lifestyle habits are potential confounders in a study, the investigators can limit the impact by selecting controls that match cases (Green et al., 2011). An example of confounding occurred when researchers were trying to link cigarette smoking to lung cancer. There was an established association that cigarette smokers had higher lung cancer rates, but this could have been due to other exposures or lifestyle factors and not the cigarette smoking. An argument could be made that individuals who smoke cigarettes are more likely to live in areas of higher pollution and that the pollution is causing the cancer. The confounding variable here is air pollution.</para>

<title>Establishing Causation</title>
<para id="para-00151"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00043">Causation</term> refers to an increase in disease incidence among exposed subjects that would not have occurred if these subjects had not been exposed. Epidemiology cannot prove causation, but causation can be inferred from the data that epidemiologists and public health professionals analyze and interpret. In assessing causation, epidemiologists look for alternative explanations for the association, such as chance, bias, or confounding as mentioned previously. After this process has ruled out these sources of error, epidemiologists use the following nine factors—the Bradford Hill criteria, commonly referred to as Hill’s criteria for causation—to guide them in making judgments about causation (<link target-id="table-00002" document="m00163"/>).</para>

<title>Chapter Summary</title>
<para id="para-00152">Ratios can be used as a descriptive measure or to calculate the occurrence of illness or death between two groups. Proportions are often used to describe the extent of disease attributable to a particular exposure. A rate measures the frequency of an event’s occurrence in a specified population over a defined period. Epidemiologists use rates to describe incidence, prevalence, case-fatality, and attack rates. Measures of morbidity characterize how many individuals in a population become or are ill at a specified time. Mortality rate measures the frequency of death in a defined population during a specific interval. Measures of association assess the degree to which the risk of disease increases when exposed to an agent, thereby demonstrating the strength of a causal relationship.</para>
