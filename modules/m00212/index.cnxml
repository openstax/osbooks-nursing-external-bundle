<para id="para-00002">As discussed in <link document="m00205">Cultural Influences on Health Beliefs and Practices</link>, diversity refers to the differences among clients in terms of their culture, race, ethnicity, religion, language, customs, beliefs, and other factors that shape their health care needs and preferences. Culturally competent care involves acknowledging diversity, respecting and valuing it, and providing care sensitive to each client’s needs and preferences.</para>
<para id="para-00003">Cultural impacts on nursing care include differences in health care outcomes for racial and ethnic groups, which can vary significantly from one region to another and may result from structural inequities or cultural preferences in care. Other factors influencing cultural competence in nursing care include race, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">socioeconomics</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">health literacy</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">language barriers</term>. Additionally, increasing the diversity of the nursing workforce can improve client care, as it helps ensure that clients receive care from health care providers who understand their cultural backgrounds.</para>

<title>Cultural Nursing Assessment</title>
<para id="para-00004">A <term id="term-00004">cultural nursing assessment</term> systematically identifies the beliefs, values, meanings, and behaviors of an individual client or population while considering their history, life experiences, and social and physical environments. In a brief cultural assessment, the nurse should ask about ethnic background, religious preference, family patterns, food preferences, eating patterns, and health practices (Narayan et al., 2022). A cultural assessment can provide the information needed for a nurse to engage in effective <term id="term-00005">cultural bridging</term>, in which the nurse recognizes the elements of care that may be different from what a client is accustomed to and respectfully explains what the client can expect and why. A respectful exchange of information benefits both the nurse and the client and leads to better health outcomes.</para>
<para id="para-00005">Community health nurses are crucial in delivering culturally appropriate care to diverse populations. It is essential for these nurses to actively engage in efforts to provide care that respects the unique needs of individuals from different backgrounds. By involving clients in their care and empowering them to participate in decisions regarding their health-related goals, plans, and interventions, nurses help to ensure improvement in both client compliance and outcomes. As a community health nurse, embracing a continuous learning mindset is vital. It is important to have a commitment to ongoing personal and professional growth while also seeking to deepen the understanding of others. By striving to provide the best possible care and continuously expanding knowledge, community health nurses can ensure they contribute effectively to the well-being of their diverse client populations.</para>

<title>Culturally Sensitive Environment</title>
<para id="para-00008">Nurses perform cultural assessments by first establishing a culturally sensitive environment and then incorporating a cultural assessment when caring for all clients. A <term id="term-00006">culturally sensitive environment</term> is a health care setting that is respectful and responsive to clients’ and their families’ cultural backgrounds, beliefs, and values. It is an environment that recognizes and values the diversity of clients and strives to provide care free from cultural bias or discrimination.</para>
<para id="para-00009">A culturally sensitive physical environment in health care incorporates various characteristics to accommodate clients’ diverse cultural needs This includes displaying décor, symbols, and artwork that reflect the diversity of the client population, providing multilingual signage and communication to overcome language barriers, ensuring client privacy and modesty, and promoting a knowledgeable and diverse staff. This environment promotes open communication between health care providers and clients. It encourages clients to express their beliefs and concerns about their health and health care. It also involves providing health care services that are appropriate and effective for clients from different cultural backgrounds. This includes being aware of cultural differences in areas such as diet, lifestyle, and religious practices and adapting care to meet each client’s individual needs.</para>
<para id="para-00010">Nurses can create a culturally sensitive environment by actively promoting cultural competence, learning about and understanding the cultural backgrounds of their clients, and developing the skills necessary to provide respectful and responsive care to meet their needs. Nurses may attend cultural competence training programs, use interpreters when necessary, and create informational materials that are culturally appropriate for clients from different backgrounds. Overall, a culturally sensitive environment is essential for providing high-quality health care that is accessible and respectful to clients from diverse cultural backgrounds.</para>
<para id="para-00011">Once the nurse has established a culturally sensitive environment, they must learn about the meaning of the illness in terms of the client’s unique culture. This can be done by asking open-ended questions about the client’s background, beliefs, and values. For example, some questions to ask during a cultural assessment include “What do you think has caused your problem?” and “Why do you think it started when it did?” Effective verbal and nonverbal communication is also essential for building trust and promoting respect with the client.</para>
<para id="para-00012">Before the assessment, the nurse should know the key topics to address, how to address them without offending the client and family, and whether an interpreter is necessary.</para>

<title>Performing Cultural Nursing Assessment</title>
<para id="para-00013">A <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">culturally competent nursing assessment</term> is a process of gathering information about a client’s cultural background, beliefs, and practices to provide culturally sensitive care. The assessment aims to identify cultural factors that may influence the client’s health care needs and decisions and to develop a care plan that is respectful and responsive to the client’s cultural beliefs and practices.</para>
<para id="para-00014">The following are key components of a culturally competent nursing assessment:</para>
<list list-type="enumerated" number-style="arabic" id="list-00003">
<item>Gathering cultural information: The nurse should collect information about the client’s cultural background, including their beliefs, values, and practices related to health and illness. This includes asking the client about their language preferences, religious practices, dietary restrictions, and other cultural practices.</item>
<item>Awareness and knowledge: The nurse should have foundational knowledge about the community and diversity within the community. For example, nurses should be familiar with concepts related to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">sexual orientation</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">gender identities</term>, including common terminology.</item>
<item>Assessing <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">health literacy</term>: The nurse should assess the client’s health literacy, which is the ability to understand and use health information to make informed decisions. The nurse should use plain language and culturally appropriate materials to assess the client’s understanding of their health condition and treatment plan.</item>
<item>Identifying <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">cultural barriers</term>: The nurse should identify any cultural barriers that may affect the client’s health care access or outcomes, such as language barriers, limited access to health care services, or cultural beliefs that conflict with <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">Western medicine</term>. Understanding why clients might delay care due to the barriers they encounter when accessing safe health care can help nurses plan for a client’s ongoing care.</item>
<item>Assessing <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">cultural competence</term>: The nurse should assess their own cultural competence, including their knowledge, attitudes, and skills related to providing culturally sensitive care. This includes recognizing any <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">biases</term> or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">stereotypes</term> they may hold and addressing them appropriately.</item>
<item>Developing a culturally sensitive care plan: Based on the information gathered during the assessment, the nurse should develop a care plan that is respectful and responsive to the client’s cultural beliefs and practices. Additionally, the nurse should use inclusive and gender-neutral language and respect names and pronouns. Treatment plans may need to be adapted to accommodate cultural practices, using interpreters or culturally appropriate resources, or involving family members in the care plan.</item>
</list>
<para id="para-00015">During the assessment, the nurse should be aware of the environment. They should look around and also assess verbal and nonverbal communications.</para>
<para id="para-00016">The brief cultural assessment helps determine the need for an in-depth cultural assessment, which can be conducted throughout the nurse-client relationship as trust builds. The longer, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">Culturological Assessment</term>, a term coined by Leininger (2002), also known as the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">Cultural Assessment</term>, includes additional questions in major data categories covering a wide range of topics.

<title>Incorporating Culture into the Plan of Care</title>
<para id="para-00022">Incorporating traditions and personal views in the care plan is essential to demonstrate empathy and respect for the client’s life experience. <term id="term-00018">Empathy</term>, the ability to understand and share the feelings, perspectives, and experiences of others, is an important part of providing culturally responsive care. Nurses can establish trust and rapport by consistently demonstrating empathy and respect. Nurses should actively listen to clients, demonstrating genuine interest and using appropriate nonverbal cues such as nodding, eye contact, and facial expressions to show empathy (<link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00212"/>). Nurses should acknowledge and validate clients’ emotions and experiences, ensuring they feel heard and understood.</para>

<para id="para-00023">Here are some strategies that nurses can use to incorporate these elements in their care plan:</para>
<list list-type="enumerated" number-style="arabic" id="list-00007">
<item>Ask the client about their cultural traditions and preferences: By doing this, the nurse can gain insight into the client’s values and beliefs and incorporate these elements into the plan of care in a way that is respectful and meaningful to the client.</item>
<item>Use interpreters: If the client and the nurse do not speak the same language, using an interpreter can help the nurse understand the client’s beliefs and preferences. This can help the nurse incorporate these elements into the plan of care.</item>
<item>Involve family members (when culturally appropriate): Family members can play an essential role in incorporating traditions and personal views into the care plan. Involving family members in discussions about the plan of care can help the nurse understand the client’s cultural beliefs and preferences.</item>
<item>Be flexible: Being willing to adapt the plan of care to meet the client’s needs and preferences is essential. This can involve adjusting the timing of treatments or medications to accommodate the client’s religious practices or dietary restrictions.</item>
<item>Use culturally appropriate resources: Educational materials and videos can help the nurse provide respectful and culturally sensitive care.</item>
</list>
<para id="para-00024">Incorporating traditions and personal views into the care plan requires nurses to be open-minded, flexible, and willing to learn about the client’s cultural background and beliefs.
