<para id="para-00002">Throughout history, <term id="term-00001">geography</term> has influenced the health and well-being of communities in various ways. The environment affects the nation’s food supply and plays a role in disease transmission. Geography also affects health care delivery and health outcomes of the population. <term id="term-00002">Geographical disparities</term> refer to the differences in health care access and outcomes based upon where an individual lives. Disparities associated with <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">rural</term> or urban living are usually most frequently discussed. However, there can be health disparities between populations of different states.</para>
<para id="para-00003">The United States population is distributed among 50 states and associated territories, comprising rural and urban areas. The U.S. Census Bureau defines urban and rural based on population size and density. For an area to be considered urban, it must encompass at least 2,000 housing units or have a population of at least 5,000. Rural areas are considered all population, housing, and territory not included within an urban area (U.S. Census Bureau, 2023). Most counties in the United States have a mix of rural and urban populations (United States Department of Agriculture [USDA], 2023). According to the 2020 census, 80 percent of the U.S. population lives in urban areas, while 20 percent live in rural areas (U.S. Census, 2022).</para>

<title>Factors Influencing Population Health Related to Location</title>
<para id="para-00004">The 2022 National Healthcare Quality and Disparities Report compares health care quality and disparities scores on over 100 health-related measures among states (AHRQ, 2022), with the following results:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00002">
<item>Best overall health care quality: Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, Wisconsin, Colorado, and Utah</item>
<item>Lowest overall health quality: Alaska, Arizona, California, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Wyoming, Washington DC, Georgia, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Texas, and New York</item>
<item>Fewest racial and ethnic disparities overall: Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, Oregon, Washington, Arkansas, Kentucky, Virginia, West Virginia, Kansas, and New Jersey</item>
<item>Most racial and ethnic disparities overall: Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Minnesota, Ohio, Washington D.C., North Carolina, and Texas</item>
</list>
<para id="para-00005">There are several reasons for variations among states in terms of health care quality and disparities (AHRQ, 2022). First, health policy can vary by state. Some states may offer more health-related resources or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">social programs</term> than others. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">Health care delivery infrastructure</term> can vary by state. For example, some states regulate the construction of new hospitals and other treatment facilities more closely. Finally, disease prevalence can vary by state. For example, diabetes, arthritis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases are more prevalent in eastern U.S. states (Raghupathi &amp; Raghupathi, 2018). Diabetes, in particular, is influenced by cultural, behavioral, and environmental factors associated with certain geographical areas (Zang et al., 2020); it is more prevalent in the southeastern and Appalachian portions of the United States (CDC, 2022a). Asthma is another disease with some geographical trends, although a lot of variation related to population density and demographics can exist within a particular state. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">Northeast Mid-Atlantic asthma belt</term> (from Greensboro, North Carolina, to Boston, Massachusetts) has been shown to have a higher prevalence of asthma possibly due to poverty, poor air quality, and less access to specialists (Pate et al., 2021). The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (2018) identified a second group of states with an increased prevalence of asthma and associated ED visits and deaths. The Ohio-Lake Erie asthma belt spans from Louisville, Kentucky, up to Detroit, Michigan.</para>
<para id="para-00006">Health and related outcomes vary not only by state, but by county, town, or zip code. Research has linked zip codes to health outcomes (Holmes et al., 2018). For example, people living in neighborhoods with limited access to healthy foods and safe areas to exercise are at higher risk for health problems.</para>

<title>Factors Influencing Population Health Related to Population Density</title>
<para id="para-00008">Some of the most common geographical disparities exist between those who live in rural areas and those who live in urban areas. Individuals living in rural areas face geographic isolation, lower socioeconomic status, higher rates of health risk behaviors, limited access to health care specialists and subspecialists, and limited job opportunities (Rural Health Information Hub [RHIH], 2023). Additionally, residents who live in rural areas are less likely to be employed by organizations that provide health insurance coverage. If individuals living in rural areas also live below the poverty level, they are less likely to be covered by Medicaid (RHIH, 2023). Rural health disparities are often caused by access to health care and public health services, socioeconomic status, health behaviors, and health insurance status. Rural Americans are at a greater risk of death from heart disease, cancer, unintentional injury, chronic lower respiratory disease, and stroke than Americans who live in urban areas (RHIH, 2022). Rural residents tend to be older and more obese and to have more health problems than urban residents. They are more likely to smoke cigarettes and are less likely to use seat belts (<link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00150"/>) (FDA, 2021). <link target-id="table-00001" document="m00150"/> presents relevant factors affecting rural health outcomes.</para>

<caption>National efforts to promote the use of seat belts include public information campaigns, such as this valentine-themed graphic from the National Transportation and Safety Board. Studies have shown that residents of rural areas are less likely to wear seat belts than residents in urban areas, which is one factor contributing to higher traffic fatality rates in rural areas (CDC, 2017).

<para id="para-00014">Geography has historically influenced the health and well-being of communities, health care delivery, and health outcomes of the population. Geographical disparities are differences in health care access and outcomes based upon where an individual lives. Disparities exist between rural and urban areas, populations of different states, and even by zip code within the same county. Individuals living in rural areas face issues such as geographic isolation, lower socioeconomic status, higher rates of health risk behaviors, limited access to health care specialists and subspecialists, and limited job opportunities.</para>
