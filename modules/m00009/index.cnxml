<title>Fat Function and Metabolism</title>
<para id="para-00002"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">Fats</term> are found primarily in animal foods such as meat, high-fat dairy products, and fried food, although plants are also sources of fat in the form of oils. Fat is a concentrated energy source, supplying more than double the caloric energy of carbohydrates or protein. See <link target-id="table-00001" document="m00009"/> for the comparison of energy in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">macronutrients</term>. (Note that alcohol also provides calories, but unlike the macronutrients, it does not provide vitamins, minerals, or fiber.

<para id="para-00004">Fat adds a smooth taste to foods and contributes to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">satiety</term>. For instance, fat contributes to the flavor of a well-marbled steak, a loaded baked potato, chicken cooked with skin, cereal with whole milk, coffee with cream, and deep-fried fish with french fries. These foods are high in calories and saturated fat and may take twice as long to digest as carbohydrates, remaining in the stomach and intestine longer and staving off hunger pains. During fat digestion, the intestinal cells secrete the hormone <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">cholecystokinin</term>, which slows pancreatic function and causes longer gastric emptying, making the person feel full (Borer, 2023).</para>
<para id="para-00005">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">fat-soluble vitamins</term> A, D, E, and K are found only in fat-containing foods. They travel through the blood with fat molecules from the small intestine and are stored in the liver until needed. Because the fat-soluble vitamins are stored in the body, there is no need for daily ingestion. The storage mechanism makes deficiencies rare in the United States, except for <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">vitamin D</term> deficiency, which has seen a large uptick globally over the last decade. According to Guilbeau and Watson (2022), an estimated 18% of people in the U.S. has inadequate levels of vitamin D and 5% have vitamin D deficiency. Fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies may occur when fat is restricted or when a client receives total parental nutrition without lipids.</para>
<para id="para-00006">According to the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">U.S. dietary guidelines for Americans for 2020–2025</term>, no more than 20–35% of daily calories should come from fat; the exception is toddlers aged two to three years, for whom the goal is 30–40% (U.S. Department of Agriculture &amp; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2020). Fat is an essential nutrient critical for metabolic functions including vitamin synthesis, long-term energy storage, and the production of essential fatty acids. However, given its caloric density, too much fat, like too much carbohydrate or protein, can raise caloric intake above caloric output, causing <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">weight gain</term>.</para>

<title>Saturated Fat</title>
<para id="para-00007">A <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">saturated fat</term> is usually solid at room temperature and is found in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">animal-based foods</term> and some plant oils. Saturated fat was first linked with <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">heart disease</term> in the 1950s by Ancel Keys, who proposed the diet–heart hypothesis (Teicholz, 2023). It has been widely accepted that a decrease in saturated fat is protective against the development of cardiovascular disease (MacDonald et al., 2022). The U.S. dietary guidelines for 2020–2025 continue to include the recommendation to lower the intake of saturated fat. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">American Heart Association</term> recommends a dietary pattern that achieves 5–6% of calories from saturated fat. For example, if an individual needs about 2,000 calories a day, 120 calories at most should come from saturated fat, or approximately 13 g per day (American Heart Association, 2021). <link target-id="table-00002" document="m00009"/> lists amounts of saturated fat in some everyday foods.</para>

<para id="para-00009">There is a difference between animal monounsaturated and plant monounsaturated fats. Animal-based mono-unsaturated fats are present in eggs, poultry, red meat, fish, and full-fat dairy. Evidence demonstrates that research subjects who had “a higher intake of monounsaturated fatty acids from animals had a 21% higher risk of death from any cause” (American Heart Association, 2018). A decrease in mortality was observed when <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">monounsaturated fats</term> such as olive oil were substituted for saturated fats (Guasch-Ferre et al., 2019).</para>

<title>Polyunsaturated Fats</title>
<para id="para-00010">Two well-known <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">polyunsaturated fats</term> are <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020">omega-3</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00021">omega-6</term> fatty acids. Omega-3 fats play a role in heart health and are found in eggs, soybeans, flaxseed, canola oil, and fatty fish such as salmon. The role of omega-6 fatty acid in heart health is more complex than that of omega-3. Its greatest effect appears to be strengthening of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00022">immune system</term>. Omega-6 fatty acids are found in sunflower, safflower, soy, sesame, and corn oils.</para>
<para id="para-00011">Polyunsaturated fatty acids are known for their health properties and anti-inflammatory action (Currenti et al., 2022). Polyunsaturated fats should make up no more than about 11% of the 20–35% of daily calories from fat (Liu et al., 2016). <link target-id="table-00004" document="m00009"/> presents a comparison of the polyunsaturated content of common cooking <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00023">oils</term>.</para>

<title>Trans Fats</title>
<para id="para-00013">Artificially produced <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">trans fats</term> have been used as food stabilizers in baked goods, snacks, and fried fast foods for more than 100 years (Amico et al, 2021). Trans fats make potato chips crisp and margarine spreadable, and they add texture to peanut butter. Trans fats also appear on food labels as partially <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00025">hydrogenated oils</term>, which are created when food manufacturers take unsaturated oils and mechanically add hydrogen ions, thereby making the liquid oil more saturated and partially firm.</para>
<para id="para-00014">Decades of research associating trans fats with elevated <term id="term-00026">low-density lipoprotein</term> (LDL), a significant cholesterol-carrying molecule in the blood, and lowered <term id="term-00027">high-density lipoprotein</term> (HDL), a protein/lipid molecule that removes <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">cholesterol</term> from the blood, coupled with much grassroots advocacy, resulted in mandated food labeling of trans fat in 2006. Yet, it took more than 25 years to enact a ban on artificial trans fats in food products from the time they were first noted to be harmful. (Amico et al., 2021). Small amounts of naturally occurring trans fats are found in meat and dairy products. However, they do not appear to have the same negative impact as artificial trans fats and are not harmful if consumed in moderation (Bendsen et al., 2011).</para>

<title>Cooking and Food Preparation Techniques</title>
<para id="para-00015">Fat adds flavor to food, but most Americans consume more daily fat than recommended for heart health. Fat is an essential nutrient, and in a varied meal plan of whole grains, lean meats, and fresh fruits and vegetables, excessive dietary fat is not usually an issue. However, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029">cooking techniques</term> can take the healthiest of foods and add unneeded fat. A common example of a cooking technique that adds fat is deep frying, which can increase a food’s caloric content by 50% or more. Vegetables are low in fat, but when breaded and fried, the caloric and fat content climb, significantly reducing the health benefits. For example, battering and frying mushrooms, onion rings, and cauliflower change the nutrition profile by adding a significant amount of fat to a food group with negligible fat.</para>
<para id="para-00016">Alternatives to deep frying have emerged with the widespread marketing of countertop air fryers. This innovative cooking tool “fries” food with hot air and can save 70–80% of calories (Watson, 2021). Other more conventional ways to eliminate fat include grilling, baking, roasting, or boiling food items and adding flavor with seasonings or with low-fat rather than full-fat sauces. In baking, a 50% reduction of fat can be accomplished by substituting applesauce, canned pumpkin, pureed prunes, or mashed bananas for butter. (Using low-fat margarine in baking is not recommended because these products have added water and will affect the texture of the baked item.) Fat in the form of monounsaturated fatty acids can be added by sauteing vegetables in olive oil or by adding avocado or minimally processed peanut butter to toast.</para>
<para id="para-00017">Food preparation techniques, such as adding heavy dressing to a green salad, can also alter a food’s nutrition profile. Loading a baked potato with butter, sour cream, cheese, and bacon can increase its calories dramatically. Eating simple foods without high-fat enhancements is a real starting point for better health.</para>

<title>Special Considerations for Individuals Who Face Challenges Securing Adequate Fat Intake</title>
<para id="para-00018">Fat intake is a challenge for many people who consume a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00030">Western diet</term>. However, the challenge is not securing adequate fat but controlling the overconsumption of fat. For more than 100 years, scientists and researchers have believed that fat plays a role in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00031">heart disease</term>. Researchers are widely convinced that saturated fat increases LDL cholesterol and is a significant causal factor in the development of heart disease (Kris-Etherton &amp; Krauss, 2020).</para>
<para id="para-00019">The lack of enzymes or emulsifying agents (i.e., bile) that help digest fat impacts dietary guidance on fat intake. Clients who have their gallbladder removed are encouraged to avoid high-fat, fried, and greasy foods, such as fatty sauces and gravies (Rajan, 2021), for at least a week after surgery.</para>
<para id="para-00020">Today, a “food replacement message” is this: Replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat, or monounsaturated fat, and trading ultra-processed foods for a diet rich in whole, minimally processed foods may lower heart disease. This food replacement message resonates with the U.S. dietary guidelines and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s MyPlate food guide and should be at the core of food literacy.</para>
