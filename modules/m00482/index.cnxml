    <para id="para-00006">All OpenStax textbooks undergo a rigorous review process. However, like any professional-grade textbook, errors sometimes occur. In addition, the wide range of topics, data, and legal circumstances in sociology change frequently, and portions of the textbook may become out of date. Since our books are web-based, we can make updates periodically when deemed pedagogically necessary. If you have a correction to suggest, submit it through the link on your book page on OpenStax.org. Subject matter experts review all errata suggestions. OpenStax is committed to remaining transparent about all updates, so you will also find a list of past and pending errata changes on your book page on OpenStax.org.</para>

    <title><emphasis effect="bold">Summary</emphasis></title>
    <para id="para-00008"><emphasis effect="italics">Pharmacology for Nurses</emphasis> aims to provide a fundamental understanding of the therapeutic use of drugs so the nurse can provide safe and effective care to the client. It is important for nursing students to comprehend not only the mechanisms by which drugs impact the human body, but also how the individual’s physiological factors influence drug responses. Along with a discussion of each body system, the text also reviews the pathophysiology of various disease processes and medications used in treatment. The textbook is intended for pre-licensure nursing students in an introductory program. <emphasis effect="italics">Pharmacology for Nurses</emphasis> helps students prepare for the licensing exam by offering applicable, real-life content in short, manageable sections; it focuses on common client conditions that nurses will encounter throughout their career and embraces a skills orientation (what does a nurse <emphasis effect="italics">do</emphasis>). Most importantly, <emphasis effect="italics">Pharmacology for Nurses</emphasis> will give students the confidence to safely administer medications to clients as well as provide medication education to clients and their caregivers.</para>
    <para id="para-00009">Pharmacology is often considered one of the more challenging courses in nursing school; however, this book presents the information in a holistic manner that ties the disease process to its pharmacological treatment. This approach will assist students in connecting the pathophysiology of the disease process to the nursing care of the client. Being an effective caregiver requires the nurse to have a solid understanding of the disease process, allowing for the proper assessment and treatment of the client. Due to the number of drugs that are used in clinical practice, one drug is used for each class of medication as a representative drug prototype to help facilitate student learning.</para>

    <title><emphasis effect="bold">Organizational Framework</emphasis></title>
    <para id="para-00010">The table of contents presents 40 chapter topics organized into 11 units. The first unit, consisting of 3 chapters, provides a broad overview of pharmacology, with the following 10 units focused on specific body systems. In each unit, after a review of the body system anatomy, the following chapters discuss pathological conditions and how they are managed and treated with medications.</para>
    <para id="para-00011">One of the primary reasons for nurses to learn about pharmacology is to provide safe, effective care of the client; however, it is also important for nurses to be able to educate the client and family about the drugs that have been prescribed. Each chapter has integrated nursing implications and client teaching as features of each class of drugs.</para>
    <para id="para-00012">Although the chapters in <emphasis effect="italics">Pharmacology for Nurses</emphasis> are written to be mostly independent, they do generally build on the understanding gained in the previous chapters, including occasional cross-references, particularly within a body system unit. (Please bear this in mind when considering alternate sequence coverage.) Instructors may pair the chapters from this pharmacology textbook with similar body system topics in a disease course.</para>
    <para id="para-00013">A working knowledge of basic microbiology, chemistry, and anatomy and physiology will be helpful to students reading this book. To develop sound clinical judgement, students will also need an understanding of the nursing process to link the disease process to the recommended pharmacological treatment.</para>
    <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00001">
    <item><emphasis effect="bold">Unit 1</emphasis> (Chapters 1–3) introduces an overview of pharmacology, drug administration, and quality and safety. Unit 1 also emphasizes the crucial role of ethics in medication administration with a focus on safety, informed consent, and the prevention of medication errors. These ethical considerations are vital in today’s health care context, especially given the current legal implications and potential consequences of drug administration errors.</item>
    <item><emphasis effect="bold">Unit 2</emphasis> (Chapters 4–5) discusses homeostasis within the body and the importance of fluids, electrolytes, vitamins, and minerals in the maintenance of homeostasis. Unit 2 also covers alternative/complementary therapies.</item>
    <item><emphasis effect="bold">Unit 3</emphasis> (Chapters 6–8) discusses inflammatory response within the body. Unit 3 includes coverage of drugs to treat certain alterations within the immune system, such as infections, cancer, HIV/AIDS, and organ transplants.</item>
    <item><emphasis effect="bold">Unit 4</emphasis> (Chapters 9–15) discusses the nervous system and provides comprehensive coverage of medications for pain management, substance abuse, and psychotropics for mental health (including anxiety, depression, insomnia, mood stabilization, and psychosis).</item>
    <item><emphasis effect="bold">Units 5–11</emphasis> (Chapters 16–40) cover medications for system disorders for the cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine, digestive, renal and urinary, reproductive, sensory, and dermatologic systems. This section of the book also features the topics of weight management, treatment of transgender and nonbinary individuals, and sexually transmitted infections.</item>
