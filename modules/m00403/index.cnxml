<media alt="The organs of the endocrine system, including the pituitary gland, thyroid, adrenal glands, and pancreas are shown in their anatomical location (in the head and torso). The pituitary gland is located below the brain. The thyroid starts in the throat and goes down toward the lungs. The adrenal glands are below the lungs, and the pancreas is located between the adrenal glands."><image mime-type="image/jpeg" src="../../media/PHA_Unit07_26_28_001_Splash.jpg"/></media>

<para id="para-00001">The <term id="term-00001">endocrine system</term> serves as a crucial communication network within the body, regulating important functions such as growth and development, reproduction, energy use, and electrolyte balance. The endocrine system closely interacts with the nervous system to maintain <term id="term-00002">homeostasis</term> and ensure adequate responses to various stressors. This chapter will cover the pharmacologic agents utilized for managing endocrine disorders affecting the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and adrenal cortex.</para>
