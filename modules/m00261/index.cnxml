<para id="para-00002">Currently there is no cure for PD. Although pharmacologic management is a first-line treatment, drugs only provide symptomatic relief; they do not cease or reverse the neuronal degeneration. Unfortunately, although symptoms may significantly improve at first, the symptoms frequently reappear over time as the disease worsens and drugs become less effective.</para>
<para id="para-00003">Drugs are given to restore the balance of dopamine and ACh in certain areas of the brain. This can be achieved by increasing dopamine levels with dopaminergics (classes of drugs that have different mechanisms of action), such as dopamine agonists, monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitors, and catechol-<emphasis effect="italics">O</emphasis>-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors. Drugs are also given to block the excitatory actions of ACh. These are cholinergic antagonists (anticholinergics). Many times, the client is on combination therapy to prolong the therapeutic effects. Notably, administering exogenous dopamine is not an option because it has difficulty crossing the blood–brain barrier and has an extremely short half-life.</para>

<title>Anticholinergics</title>
<para id="para-00004"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">Anticholinergics</term> are not as frequently used as they were in the past due to their multiple adverse effects. Several interchangeable terms are used for the medication class of anticholinergics—<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">cholinergic blockers</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">muscarinic antagonists</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">parasympatholytics</term>—all of which have the same meaning. Anticholinergic agents produce their effects by preventing the activation of muscarinic receptors. These drugs work in opposition to cholinergic agonists. The two most common anticholinergics are benztropine mesylate and trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride (Parkinson’s Foundation, 2023a).</para>
<note class="clinical-tip" id="note-00001">
<title><emphasis effect="bold">Differences in Receptor Sensitivity</emphasis></title>
<para id="para-00005">Not all muscarinic receptors are equally sensitive to blockade by most of the anticholinergic agents. At some sites, only a small concentration of drug is required to effectively block receptors. These drugs are considered high-potency agents. At other sites, a higher concentration is needed. Using higher concentrations of a muscarinic antagonist will result in increased risk of adverse effects.</para>
</note>
<para id="para-00006">Benztropine mesylate possesses both anticholinergic and antihistaminic effects, although only the anticholinergic action has been established to be the source of therapeutic effectiveness in managing PD. Despite the ability to divide doses into two or three daily, clients experience greatest relief by taking the entire dose at bedtime. The drug’s long duration of action makes it suitable for bedtime medication because its effects may last throughout the night, enabling clients to turn in bed during the night more easily and to rise in the morning without having much difficulty (DailyMed, <emphasis effect="italics">Benztropine Mesylate,</emphasis> 2021).</para>
<para id="para-00007">There are no significant differences between trihexyphenidyl and benztropine. Both are predominantly used for reducing tremors and dystonia in younger people. The drugs should be avoided in the older adult client due to the potential adverse effects.</para>

<title>Adverse Effects and Contraindications</title>
<para id="para-00009">This drug classification can cause numerous adverse effects, which is why it is not used as commonly as it was in the past. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009"><term id="term-00010">Anhidrosis</term></term> can occur from the decreased secretion from sweat glands. This can be dangerous because the body is unable to release heat, which can lead to hyperthermia or heat stroke. Dry mouth, due to the decrease in salivation, can become very severe, resulting in difficulty with swallowing or speaking. This increases the client’s risk for choking and/or aspiration pneumonia. Dry mouth can also cause dental caries, halitosis (bad breath), gum problems, and oral infections. A slight reduction in dosage may control nausea and still give sufficient relief of symptoms (DailyMed, <emphasis effect="italics">Benztropine Mesylate,</emphasis> 2021; Parkinson’s Foundation, 2023a).</para>
<para id="para-00010">Clients with mental disorders may experience an intensification of mental symptoms. In such cases, anti-Parkinsonian drugs can precipitate a toxic psychosis characterized by confusion, memory impairment, visual hallucinations, delusions, and nervousness. Clients with mental disorders should be kept under careful observation.</para>
<para id="para-00011">Blockade of cholinergic receptors in the eye may precipitate or aggravate glaucoma because it increases the aqueous humor in the anterior chamber by disrupting the exit of the fluid. In addition, these drugs cause mydriasis (pupil dilation) by blocking muscarinic receptors on the ciliary muscle and sphincter of the iris; paralysis of the iris sphincter results, preventing pupil constriction. The eye is unable to adapt to bright light, which causes photophobia or intolerance to light (DailyMed, <emphasis effect="italics">Benztropine Mesylate</emphasis>, 2021; Parkinson’s Foundation, 2023a).</para>
<para id="para-00012">Blocking cardiac muscarinic receptors will eliminate parasympathetic nervous system influence on the heart. Anticholinergics cause an increase in heart rate, which can cause dysrhythmias in a client with preexisting tachycardia or a co-existing condition, such as hyperthyroidism. Urinary retention can occur due to the blockade of muscarinic receptors of the urinary tract. This relaxes the detrusor muscle, which reduces pressure within the bladder and increases the tone of the urinary internal sphincter, placing the client at risk for urinary tract infections. Also, muscarinic antagonists block receptors in the intestine, decreasing the tone and motility of the intestinal smooth muscle. This can result in constipation or paralytic ileus. Furthermore, because anticholinergics block muscarinic receptors in the bronchi, they can promote bronchial dilation. This is a benefit for those who have asthma; however, these drugs also cause drying and thickening of bronchial secretions, which can lead to mucus plugging. Asthmatics must be closely monitored (Capriotti, 2022).</para>
<para id="para-00013">If a client has any type of intestinal or urinary obstruction, like benign prostatic hypertrophy, these medications should be avoided because they will worsen the condition. Those with a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis should avoid anticholinergics because they could further reduce ACh’s ability to send signals, which could worsen symptoms or trigger a crisis.</para>
<para id="para-00014">Antihistamines, first-generation antipsychotics, and tricyclic antidepressants should not be used concurrently with anticholinergics because these agents also possess antimuscarinic properties. The combination of multiple anticholinergic drugs can worsen the adverse effects mentioned previously. The use of alcohol can increase the risk of psychosis. Cholinergic agents, such as bethanechol used for urinary retention, can negate the effects of the anticholinergic agents because these drugs stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system by mimicking the action of ACh.</para>

<title>Dopaminergics</title>
<para id="para-00021"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">Dopaminergic</term> means related to dopamine. Dopamine constitutes approximately 80% of the <term id="term-00015">catecholamine</term> content within the brain. Dopamine is known to have an essential role in nearly all cognitive functions, including self-initiated motor control, motivation, and learning (Costa &amp; Schoenbaum, 2022). Dopaminergic substances increase dopamine-related activity in the brain. These dopaminergic substances are also referred to as dopamine replacers when dopaminergic neurons are dysfunctional or destroyed, such as what occurs in PD. Neurons that synthesize or contain dopamine and synapses with dopamine receptors in them may also be labeled as dopaminergic. Enzymes that regulate the biosynthesis or metabolism of dopamine, such as dopamine decarboxylase, MAO, and COMT, also are deemed dopaminergic. In addition, any endogenous or exogenous chemical substances that affect dopamine receptors or dopamine release can be said to have dopaminergic properties. Two prominent examples are opioids and amphetamines.</para>
<section id="sect-00007">
<title>Levodopa</title>
<para id="para-00022">Levodopa was introduced in the 1960s and has been a cornerstone of PD treatment for many years (Ovallath &amp; Sulthana, 2017). Levodopa is a metabolic precursor of dopamine and is inactive until it undergoes conversion to its active state. This drug has proven to be extremely beneficial in the early stages of PD. Unfortunately, over time, the number of neurons decreases, and fewer cells are capable of converting the levodopa to dopamine. Motor fluctuations then develop, and the client experiences the relief of symptoms only when the drug is present.</para>
<para id="para-00023">The purpose of this drug is to replenish the brain’s reduced supply of dopamine by increasing dopamine synthesis. Levodopa is absorbed in the blood from the small intestine and travels through the circulation to the brain. Once it crosses the blood–brain barrier, it binds to dopamine receptors on GABA neurons, helping to restore the balance between neurotransmitters (Parkinson’s Foundation, 2023b).</para>
<para id="para-00024">Levodopa is not used as a monotherapy; given alone it is not beneficial. It should be administered with carbidopa (discussed later in this chapter). Without the combination, a large majority of levodopa gets decarboxylated in the periphery—causing systemic effects such as nausea and vomiting, dysrhythmias, and hypotension—and resulting in less levodopa crossing the blood–brain barrier. The drug combination increases the amount available to cross the blood–brain barrier.</para>
<para id="para-00025">Inbrija is an inhaled levodopa powder that is a dopamine precursor commonly used for early morning or sudden “off” episodes. These episodes are seen when levodopa’s effects wear off before the next dose is due. The inhalation route enables a low but quicker acting boost of dopamine. Inbrija is not intended to replace a client’s maintenance medications but is given concurrently with levodopa/carbidopa. The drug comes in a capsule and must be administered through the appropriate inhaler device. Inhalation-specific contraindications include asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or other long-term underlying lung disease (DailyMed, <emphasis effect="italics">Inbrija</emphasis>, 2023).</para>
</section>
<section id="sect-00008">
<title>Carbidopa/Levodopa</title>
<para id="para-00026">Carbidopa is a dopamine decarboxylase inhibitor; combined with levodopa, levodopa’s effects are enhanced. The drug inhibits decarboxylation of levodopa in the intestines and peripheral tissues. Therefore, less levodopa is converted into dopamine within the periphery, and more is available to cross the blood–brain barrier. This is beneficial, not only to increase the amount of dopamine that reaches the brain, but also to diminish the adverse effects dopamine causes when circulating in the periphery. Combining levodopa with carbidopa allows the dosage of levodopa to be reduced by 75%. Carbidopa has no pharmacological effects on its own and is unable to cross the blood–brain barrier. This drug combination stops the motor symptoms early in the disease process but has no effect on the disease itself.</para>
<para id="para-00027">Therapeutic effects may not be seen for weeks or months. This drug should be taken on an empty stomach, typically 30 minutes before a meal. Food can significantly decrease absorption, especially a large amount of protein. Carbidopa decreases nausea and vomiting and the cardiovascular response by reducing the amount of dopamine in the periphery (DailyMed, <emphasis effect="italics">Sinemet,</emphasis> 2022). Levodopa comes in multiple forms and is administered via several routes, including oral (immediate-release, control-release, and extended-release) tablets, intestinal gel, and inhalation.</para>
<para id="para-00028">DUOPA is the intestinal gel form of carbidopa/levidopa delivered through a surgically implanted tube in the small intestine. This drug is used for clients who have advanced disease and have difficulty swallowing. The overall goal of this delivery method is to increase “on” time episodes. The maximum recommended daily dose of DUOPA is 2,000 mg administered over 16 hours (Parkinson’s Foundation, 2023b). Distinct contraindications for this route include complications from the insertion of the intestinal tube or incision site inflammation (DailyMed, <emphasis effect="italics">DUOPA</emphasis>, 2022).</para>

<title>Adverse Effects and Contraindications</title>
<para id="para-00030">Nausea and vomiting are common symptoms that usually disappear after a few months on levodopa/carbidopa. The symptoms are usually caused by activation of dopamine receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone, which contains receptors that detect emetic agents in the blood and relay that information to the vomiting center<emphasis effect="italics">.</emphasis> This is reduced with carbidopa. Carbidopa can be given as a single drug (Lodosyn). If added to levodopa/carbidopa, the extra carbidopa can reduce levodopa-induced nausea and vomiting. It also allows smaller doses of levodopa to be used while promoting a faster response.</para>
<para id="para-00031">Conversion of levodopa to dopamine in the periphery can produce excessive activation of beta-adrenergic receptors in the heart. Dysrhythmias can result, especially in clients with heart disease. Clients with preexisting coronary artery disease may take propranolol to counteract cardiac dysrhythmias.</para>
<para id="para-00032">“Wearing off” develops near the end of the dosing interval, indicating drug levels have declined to a subtherapeutic value. This can be minimized in three ways: (1) shortening the dosing interval, (2) giving a drug that prolongs levodopa’s plasma half-life (MAO-B inhibitors or COMT inhibitors), or (3) giving a direct-acting dopamine agonist. “On-off” episodes occur any time during the dosing interval, even if drug levels are high. These episodes may last from minutes to hours. Over time, off periods usually increase in both intensity and frequency. One reason these episodes occur in PD is because the gastrointestinal (GI) motility decreases, delaying absorption of levodopa and altering serum levels.</para>
<para id="para-00033">About 80% of clients treated with levodopa will experience drug-induced <term id="term-00024">dyskinesias</term> during the advanced stages of the disease and 30% will develop it after only 3 years of levodopa treatment (Kwon et al., 2022). Some of these are just bothersome (head bobbing tics, grimacing), whereas others can be disabling, such as <term id="term-00025">ballismus</term>—rapid, involuntary jerking or flinging of proximal muscle groups—or <term id="term-00026">choreoathetosis</term>—slow, involuntary, writhing movements. Levodopa exacerbates symptoms of psychosis, possibly through the buildup of central dopamine. Urine and sweat can become brownish because of the melanin produced from catecholamine oxidation.</para>
<para id="para-00034">This drug can cause clients to become impulsive. Clients may either begin to engage in or increase already existing gambling/sexual urges, or uncontrolled spending. This is due to the increase of dopamine in the brain.</para>
<para id="para-00035">There have been reports of clients suddenly falling asleep without warning of feeling drowsy. Before these sleep attacks, the clients were engaged in performing activities of daily living, driving a vehicle, or conversing. If these occur, the drug should be discontinued. Importantly, the drug should not be stopped abruptly because it could lead to the reemergence of signs and symptoms of PD, sometimes worse than the initial manifestations.

<para id="para-00037">Epidemiological studies have shown that clients with PD have a higher risk (two- to approximately six-fold) of developing melanoma than the general population. It is unknown whether this is due to PD itself or the drugs used in the treatment of PD. Clients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using carbidopa and levodopa for any indication. Ideally, periodic skin examinations should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists).</para>
<para id="para-00038">First-generation antipsychotics block receptors for dopamine in the striatum, diminishing the therapeutic effects of levodopa. This may augment Parkinsonian symptoms. Low doses of atypical antipsychotics are sometimes used to treat levodopa-induced psychotic symptoms. Nonselective MAO inhibitors (MAOIs) can result in a hypertensive crisis if administered to a client taking levodopa. Nonselective MAOIs should be withdrawn at least 2 weeks before starting levodopa. Dopamine receptor antagonists, such as phenothiazines, risperidone, or metoclopramide, should be avoided because they will decrease the effects due to their dopamine receptor antagonistic properties.</para>
<para id="para-00039">If levodopa is administered alone, pyridoxine (B<sub>6</sub>) will decrease its effects (greater than 200 mg daily) because it enhances decarboxylase and increases peripheral breakdown of levodopa. If given in combination with carbide, this is not a concern. Other antihypertensives can exacerbate orthostatic hypotension. Iron salts can form chelates with levodopa and reduce its bioavailability. Because amino acids compete with levodopa for intestinal absorption and for transport across the blood–brain barrier, high-protein foods will reduce levodopa’s therapeutic effects.</para>

<title>Dopamine Agonists</title> 
<para id="para-00048"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00036">Dopamine agonists</term> are first-line drugs in the treatment of mild to moderate PD. These drugs mimic the role of dopamine in the brain. Their duration is longer than compared with levodopa. They are relatively selective for D2 receptors. Activating these receptors causes increased dopamine levels in the nigrostriatal pathway, which leads to smooth and coordinated movements. This classification is used as a monotherapy or in combination with levodopa. Initial therapy is associated with less risk of developing dyskinesias and motor fluctuations compared with clients started on levodopa. Dopamine agonists may delay the need to use levodopa in early PD and may decrease the dose of levodopa in advanced PD. When used on a long-term basis, they have a lower incidence of response failures. In addition, they can be used as an adjunct medication to supplement levodopa when further dopaminergic effect is needed or if complications of levodopa treatment arise, such as dyskinesias, “wearing off,” and motor fluctuations. These drugs will be ineffective in clients who do not improve with levodopa (American Parkinson Disease Association, 2014).</para>
<para id="para-00049">Dopamine agonists are divided into ergot and nonergot derivatives. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00037">ergot derivatives</term> are nonselective and block serotonergic and alpha-adrenergic receptors. Because of this, the ergots cause more cardiovascular concerns. The nonergot derivatives are selective for dopamine receptor subtypes. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00038">nonergot derivatives</term> have similar mechanisms of actions, adverse effects, and interactions. This information can be found below. Any distinct changes are mentioned with the specific drug sections.</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00008">
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Pramipexole:</emphasis> A nonergot dopamine agonist that selectively binds to dopamine-2 receptor subtypes, which activates CNS postsynaptic dopamine receptors in the striatum. This drug is mainly used as a monotherapy in the early stages of PD. As the disease progresses, it is used in combination with levodopa (DailyMed, <emphasis effect="italics">Pramipexole dihydrochloride,</emphasis> 2022).</item>
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Ropinirole:</emphasis> Essentially the same as pramipexole. This drug should be discontinued over a 7-day period to prevent adverse reactions such as confusion, rigidity, or hyperpyrexia.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Rotigotine:</emphasis> Similar to pramipexole, but one main difference is the route. Rotigotine is only available as a daily transdermal patch. This is beneficial for those who are unable to take oral formulations due to dysphagia. This route provides unfluctuating drug levels over 24 hours. The other difference is this drug can cause peripheral edema (cause unknown) or skin reactions at the site of application (DailyMed, <emphasis effect="italics">Neupro,</emphasis> 2022).</item>
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Apomorphine hydrochloride:</emphasis> Another nonergot derivative, this is a short-acting drug delivered by subcutaneous injection or sublingually. This drug is reserved as an acute “rescue” medication to treat “off” episodes in between doses or “off-on” periods that occur randomly in clients with advanced PD. Both routes have a rapid onset of action. Their mechanism of action is the same as for pramipexole. The injection route is advantageous for those unable to adequately or safely swallow. A duration of at least 2 hours between doses is highly recommended, and five doses a day is maximum. To prevent a medication error, the prescribed dose needs to be written in milliliters because the multi-dose pen has markings in milliliters. This is a highly emetogenic drug (induces vomiting); therefore, it is routinely given concurrently with an antiemetic such as trimethobenzamide 300 mg three times a day starting 3 days before the first dose and continued as needed to control nausea and vomiting. Use should generally not exceed 2 months (DailyMed, <emphasis effect="italics">Apomorphine hydrochloride,</emphasis> 2022).</item>
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Bromocriptine:</emphasis> An ergot derivative. Because the ergot derivatives are nonselective, they block other receptors, such as serotonergic and adrenergic receptors. This causes a variety of adverse effects unseen with the nonergot derivatives (DailyMed, <emphasis effect="italics">Bromocriptine mesylate</emphasis>, 2021).</item>

<title>Adverse Effects and Contraindications</title>
<para id="para-00053">Nonergot derivatives are known to produce unusual effects, such as compulsive gambling, hypersexuality, overspending, and overeating. These behaviors are dose related and will reverse when the drug is discontinued. Providers should screen for compulsive and addictive behaviors before starting medication. Also, clients may not be aware of this behavior so they should be specifically asked about it. Another unusual effect is these medications can make one quickly fall asleep while performing daily activities. Often the person will not feel drowsy before falling asleep. This creates an elevated risk of injury and/or accidents.</para>
<para id="para-00054">Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating unrelated to heat or exercise) is caused by the dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system, which could be related to PD or the dopamine agonist. Hyperhidrosis can result in dehydration and electrolyte loss. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00053">Older adults</term> and clients with a history of psychiatric disorders are more sensitive and at increased risk of experiencing confusion and hallucinations. Dyskinesias are seen more frequently in the aforementioned dopamine agonists when combined with levodopa. Clinical studies have revealed this drug class has teratogenic effects and should be avoided in pregnancy and breastfeeding (DailyMed, <emphasis effect="italics">Pramipexole Dihydrochloride</emphasis>, 2022).</para>
<para id="para-00055">Cardiovascular disease may occur due to severe hypotension and impaired perfusion. Orthostatic hypotension occurs due to a dopamine-mediated blunting of the noradrenergic response to standing and subsequent decrease in peripheral vascular resistance. Valvular heart disease occurs due to activation of serotonin receptors on the heart valves.</para>
<para id="para-00056">Antipsychotics or dopamine antagonists will cancel the dopamine agonist effects. Higher doses of estrogens reduce clearance of the drug. Starting or stopping hormone replacement therapy may require adjustment of dosage. Because significant hypotension and loss of consciousness has occurred with these drugs when taken with serotonin receptor antagonists, this combination should be avoided.</para>
<para id="para-00057">Although apomorphine is a morphine derivative, this drug does not cause analgesia, euphoria, or respiratory depression. The most common adverse reactions specific to this drug are excessive yawning, injection-site reactions, rhinorrhea, and cardiac issues. It is important to monitor cardiac status due to the associated risk for hypotension and dose-related prolongation of the QT interval. There have been reports of chest pain, myocardial infarction, dysrhythmias, and cardiac arrest. Furthermore, this drug has the potential to exacerbate coronary and cerebral ischemia in clients with known disease. Any client with an allergy to sulfites should not receive apomorphine.</para>

<title>Adverse Effects and Contraindications</title>
<para id="para-00067">Because selegiline hydrochloride causes insomnia, taking it late in the day could disrupt sleep. Severe hypertension is a possibility if administered in high doses because the drug becomes nonselective and can then inhibit both MAO-A and MAO-B. At doses less than or equal to 10 mg/day the drug is selective for MAO-B. It does not affect MAO-A, which metabolizes tyramine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and serotonin, unless given above the recommended dose. This subtype can cause excessive stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), causing severe hypertension and possibly stroke. This crisis can be triggered by taking sympathomimetic drugs and by ingesting foods containing tyramine. High levels of tyramine are found in foods that are aged, cured, or fermented (DailyMed, <emphasis effect="italics">Selegiline Hydrochloride,</emphasis> 2023).</para>
<para id="para-00068">Several opioids should not be used concurrently with this drug classification. Combining MAO-B inhibitors with morphine can increase the opioid adverse reactions. Sympathomimetics, including over-the-counter medications containing dextromethorphan, should also be avoided due to increased risk of exaggerating psychotic symptoms. Serotonin syndrome is a life-threatening condition characterized by delirium, extreme agitation, tachycardia, labile blood pressure, rigidity, and hyperthermia. Several medications, including meperidine, tramadol, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), can increase the risk of serotonin syndrome and should be avoided. SSRIs should be stopped 2–5 weeks before the initiation of selegiline. The tapering of the SSRIs is dependent on that particular drug’s half-life. Severe CNS toxicity characterized by hyperpyrexia, seizures, changes in behavioral status, agitation, muscle rigidity, and death have been reported with combining tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and nonselective MAOIs (DailyMed, <emphasis effect="italics">Selegiline Hydrochloride</emphasis>, 2023).</para>

<para id="para-00073">Normally, the methylation of levodopa by COMT to 3-O-methyldopa is a minor pathway for levodopa metabolism; however, when peripheral dopamine decarboxylase is inhibited by carbidopa, the result is a significant increase of 3-O-methlydopa and the COMT pathway becomes more significant. This then competes with levodopa for entry into the CNS. The COMT inhibitors selectively and reversibly inhibit COMT. The inhibition of COMT leads to reduction of 3-O-methlydopa plasma concentrations. The outcome is more levodopa crossing the blood–brain barrier and increased levels of brain dopamine. These agents are beneficial in reducing the symptoms of the “wearing off” phenomenon seen with levodopa. The two <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00067">COMT inhibitors</term> discussed in this section differ primarily in their adverse drug reaction profiles. Entacapone is safer than tolcapone. These drugs have no direct effects on their own; they are only indicated for use with levodopa.</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00016">
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Entacapone:</emphasis> A selective, reversible COMT inhibitor for the treatment of PD. When administered with levodopa and a decarboxylase inhibitor (e.g., carbidopa), increased and more sustained plasma levodopa concentrations are reached as compared with the administration of levodopa and carbidopa given alone. It is believed that at a given frequency of levodopa administration, these more sustained plasma levels of levodopa result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, leading to a greater reduction in the manifestations of Parkinsonian syndrome PD (DailyMed, <emphasis effect="italics">Entacapone</emphasis>, 2022).</item>
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Tolcapone:</emphasis> Tolcapone should be reserved for clients who cannot be treated adequately with safer drugs. This drug can cause severe, sometimes fatal, hepatocellular injury. Before treatment, clients must be fully informed of the risks, and then sign an acknowledgment consent form confirming their understanding. Liver monitoring is a requirement at baseline and periodically throughout therapy. If there is any evidence of liver damage, tolcapone should be discontinued and not be used again. The enzymes generally decline within several weeks once the drug is stopped (DailyMed, <emphasis effect="italics">Tasmar</emphasis>, 2020).</item>

<title>Adverse Effects and Contraindications</title>
<para id="para-00075">Most of the adverse effects of these drugs result from the increased dopamine levels. These can be managed by decreasing the levodopa dose. GI and urinary adverse reactions are the most common manifestations of the COMT inhibitors themselves. Notably, only 10% of the dose is excreted in the urine; the remaining 90% is through biliary excretion. If there is biliary obstruction, these drugs may not get eliminated adequately and will accumulate.</para>
<para id="para-00076">There are reports of clients suddenly falling asleep without warning of feeling drowsy. If this occurs, the COMT inhibitors should be discontinued because these sleep attacks can recur.</para>
<para id="para-00077">Because these drugs increase dopamine (pleasure neurotransmitter) in the brain, they can cause intense urges to gamble, engage in sex, or spend money uncontrollably. In these cases, it may be necessary to reduce the dose or stop it altogether. Diarrhea can be experienced and is thought to be caused by drug-induced microscopic colitis. Diarrhea can lead to associated weight loss, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalance. If this occurs, the drug should be discontinued.</para>
<para id="para-00078">Dyskinesia occurs because entacapone potentiates the dopaminergic side effect of levodopa and may either cause or worsen preexisting dyskinesia.</para>
<para id="para-00079">Entacapone can increase levels of methyldopa, dobutamine, and isoproterenol because they are metabolized by the COMT enzyme. The accumulation of these drugs results in tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, and possible arrhythmias. Nonselective MAOIs should not be used concurrently. COMT and MAO are two major enzyme systems involved in metabolizing catecholamines. Combining a COMT inhibitor with a nonselective MAOI could lead to the inhibition of most of the pathways responsible for normal catecholamine metabolism. This leads to accumulation of catecholamines and sympathomimetic responses. Entacapone is a chelator of iron (DailyMed, <emphasis effect="italics">Entacapone,</emphasis> 2022).</para>
<para id="para-00080">This class is contraindicated in clients with a history of psychotic disorder who are at risk of experiencing exacerbation of symptoms. Also, certain medications used to treat psychosis may exacerbate the symptoms of PD and decrease the effectiveness of the COMT inhibitor. This drug classification should not be stopped abruptly because it could lead to the reemergence of signs and symptoms of PD, which are sometimes worse than the initial manifestations. It could also lead to confusion, muscle rigidity, hyperpyrexia, and autonomic instability that resembles NMS.</para>

<title>Case Study</title>
<para id="para-00100">Read the following clinical scenario to answer the questions that follow.</para>
<para id="para-00101">Marcus Bell is a 68-year-old client who arrives at the provider’s office reporting a tremor in his right hand that has developed gradually over several months. He notices the tremors disappear when he is concentrating on it; however, they return quickly when he gets distracted. His wife states he has had a difficult time writing. He struggles holding the pen, and his writing is very small and sloppy. The client’s wife also voiced her concerns that he never smiles anymore and he cannot keep up with her when walking. Based on the history and physical examination, the provider diagnoses Marcus with the early stages of PD. The provider prescribes carbidopa/levodopa (Sinemet) 25 mg/100 mg three times daily.<newline count="2"/>
