    <para id="para-00002">The hormones used for female reproductive health, which are covered in <link document="m00448">Reproductive Health Drugs</link>, are also discussed in this chapter; complete information for the drugs can be found there. Discussion in this chapter focuses on use of the medications for developing female secondary sex characteristics in individuals who were assigned male at birth and choose to undergo <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">male-to-female (MTF) transition</term>. These sex characteristics include fat redistribution around the hips, skin softening and decreased oiliness, growth of breast tissue, decreased muscle mass and strength, loss of facial hair, decreased libido and ejaculation volume, and decreased testicle size (<link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00457"/>). The adverse effects of female hormone therapy are related to cardiovascular conditions such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and thromboembolic events. However, studies of transgender individuals are still limited in number, and more research is needed to explore the effects of female hormones on male clients (Deutsch, 2016; Hembree et al., 2017; Ramsay &amp; Safer, 2023; Unger, 2016). Further transition would include surgery to remove the testes, as well as other feminizing surgical procedures (Mount Sinai, n.d.-b).</para>

On the face and chest, facial and body hair growth is slowed and thinned. Chest growth increases while muscle mass and strength decrease. Fat redistribution occurs in the thighs. The medicine also decreases libido, spontaneous arousal, testicular volume, and sperm production, as well as causing erectile dysfunction.">

    <title>Estrogen</title>
    <para id="para-00007">The purpose of estrogen is to continue the development of secondary female sex characteristics. Estrogen works through a negative feedback loop to suppress gonadotropin secretion from the pituitary gland and results in reduced androgen production. Usually, estrogen alone will not achieve sufficient androgen control. Thus, antiandrogenic therapy, in the form of spironolactone, may need to be added to the client’s medication regimen. Although this may seem contrary to the information regarding spironolactone—that is, starting spironolactone first and then adding estrogen—both regimens are acceptable. The specific medication regimen depends on the individual’s needs (Deutsch, 2016; Hembree et al., 2017; Mayo Clinic, 2021a; Ramsay &amp; Safer, 2023; Unger, 2016).</para>
    <para id="para-00008">Clients will notice the onset of these characteristics: smaller testicles; fewer erections and a decrease in ejaculation; decreased libido; decreased male pattern baldness; breast development; softer, less oily skin; less muscle mass; and more body fat. These changes will usually begin 1–6 months after treatment starts. The full effect will take 2–3 years (Deutsch, 2016; Hembree et al., 2017; Mayo Clinic, 2021a; Ramsay &amp; Safer, 2023; T’Sjoen et al., 2019; Unger, 2016).</para>
    <para id="para-00009">Estradiol is the most potent form of estrogen and is naturally produced in the body. Estradiol is extremely beneficial prior to menopause and for use as postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy. It provides significant protection against cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. It has been shown to work well in MTF transgender therapy also. Estradiol can be administered orally, parenterally, and transdermally.</para>

    <title>Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Analogs</title>
    <para id="para-00019">The action of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs decreases the amount of testosterone produced, which lessens the development of male secondary sex characteristics. GnRH analogs have been used for transitioning transgender adults. They may allow the client to reduce the dose of estrogen and eliminate spironolactone from the treatment regimen. However, GnRH analogs tend to be more expensive than spironolactone and may not be covered by medical insurance. Additionally, GnRH analogs require repeated injections or multiple daily nasal sprays. For these reasons, GnRH analogs may not be the best choice for some clients (Deutsch, 2016; Hembree et al., 2017; Hruz, 2020).</para>
    <para id="para-00020">One of the primary benefits of GnRH analog therapy is that once therapy is discontinued, the sex characteristics of the sex assigned at birth return. Therefore, a client who decides not to pursue transgender treatment will not have permanent changes to their body (Hembree et al., 2017; Hruz, 2020).</para>
    <para id="para-00021">On the other hand, few studies have been completed regarding the use of GnRH analogs. Thus, some of the long-term effects, adverse effects, exact dosing, and best administration method have not been determined. Adverse effects that appear to be related to GnRH analog therapy include decreased bone density, diminished adult height, and impaired spatial memory (Hembree et al., 2017; Hruz, 2020).</para>

    <title>Target for Hormone Therapy</title>
    <para id="para-00029">A reasonable target for hormone therapy for transgender female clients is to reduce testosterone levels to the typical range of 30–100 ng/dL found in cisgender female individuals without producing an above-normal level of estradiol (less than 200 pg/mL). This is accomplished by administering an antiandrogen and estrogen.</para>

    <item>Monitor serum testosterone and estradiol levels at follow-up visits, with a practical target in the female range (testosterone, 30–100 ng/dL; estradiol, less than 200 pg/mL).</item>

    <item>Monitor potassium levels if the client is taking spironolactone.</item>
    <item>Perform bone mineral density screening before the client starts hormone therapy if they are at risk for osteoporosis. Otherwise, start screening at age 60 or, if sex hormone levels are consistently low, earlier.</item>
