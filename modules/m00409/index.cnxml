<title>Thyroid and Parathyroid Glands</title>
<para id="para-00002">The <term id="term-00001">thyroid gland</term> is a butterfly-shaped gland located at the front of the neck below the voice box (see <link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00409"/>). This important gland regulates metabolism in the body through the production and secretion of thyroid hormones, which require iodine for synthesis. The thyroid gland produces the active thyroid hormone,<term id="term-00002"> triiodothyronine (T3)</term>, and the inactive thyroid hormone, <term id="term-00003">thyroxine (T4)</term>. Thyroid follicular cells secrete T3 and T4, while parafollicular cells secrete <term id="term-00004">calcitonin</term> cells that aid calcium metabolism. Follicular cells line the follicles, which are small spherical structures in the thyroid gland. They absorb iodine from the blood and combine it with T3 and T4. Parafollicular cells are scattered between the follicles of the thyroid gland. Their main function is to secrete calcitonin for calcium regulation. Calcitonin lowers the levels of calcium in the blood by inhibiting the activity of osteoclasts—cells that break down bone tissue and release calcium into the blood. When calcium levels in the blood rise, the thyroid gland releases calcitonin, which binds to receptors on the surface of osteoclasts and inhibits their activity, reducing the amount of calcium released from the bone into the blood, thereby lowering calcium levels in the blood (McLaughlin &amp; Jialal, 2022).</para>

<para id="para-00003">Thyroid hormones affect multiple body systems:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00002">
<item>the cardiac system—they have a positive inotropic effect on cardiac output and stroke volume;</item>
<item>metabolism—they play an important role through heat production and oxygen consumption;</item>
<item>the respiratory system—they help by normalizing arterial oxygen;</item>
<item>the nervous system—they stimulate the peripheral nervous system; and</item>
<item>the reproductive system—they are necessary for growth and development.</item>
</list>
<para id="para-00004">The parathyroid glands are four tiny glands that are located on the upper and lower parts of the sides of the thyroid gland (see <link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00409"/>). The parathyroid glands secrete <term id="term-00005">parathyroid hormone (PTH)</term>, which along with <term id="term-00006">dihydroxy-vitamin D<sub>3</sub></term> (vitamin D<sub>3</sub>) and calcitonin are responsible for calcium homeostasis within the body. The major target organs for PTH are the kidneys, skeletal system, and intestines. The primary responses to PTH by the kidneys are to increase renal calcium reabsorption and phosphate excretion as well as to enhance the kidney’s ability to activate vitamin D so that more calcium is absorbed through the intestine. In addition, it increases the activity of osteoclasts, thereby increasing the resorption of bone (Lofrese et al., 2022; Khan et al., 2022).</para>
<para id="para-00005">When thyroid hormone levels are insufficient within the body, a series of responses is initiated. The process begins with the hypothalamus releasing thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). This hormone acts as a communicator by interacting with the anterior pituitary gland, a small pea-sized gland located at the brain's base. In response to TRH, the anterior pituitary gland releases thyrotropin, also known as <term id="term-00007">thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)</term>. TSH stimulates the thyroid gland, prompting it to either increase or decrease the production of both T4 and T3, essential thyroid hormones.</para>
<para id="para-00006">Conversely, in cases where an excess of thyroid hormones is present, a crucial negative feedback system comes into play. Excessive levels of T4 and T3 instruct the anterior pituitary and hypothalamus to restrain the release of their respective hormones. This control mechanism is of paramount importance in maintaining a balanced hormonal environment. The influence of thyroid hormones extends beyond their impact on metabolism and energy regulation. These hormones also interact with the parathyroid glands. The secretion of calcitonin, for instance, directly interacts with calcium ions and affects parathyroid hormones. Calcitonin, functioning as an antagonist to the parathyroid gland, contributes to the intricate balance of calcium in the body. <link target-id="fig-00002" document="m00409"/> illustrates thyroid hormones that control metabolism and parathyroid hormones that control calcium homeostasis.</para>
<figure class="scaled-down" id="fig-00002">
<media alt="Thyroid hormones control metabolism using a negative feedback loop. The diagram shows the general steps of a negative feedback loop at the center (imbalance, hormone release, correction, and negative feedback) using the example of the hormone cascade that regulates metabolic rate. The hypothalamus releases TRH in response to low metabolic rate and or low T three and T four concentrations in the blood (imbalance). This triggers TSH release by the pituitary (hormone release). The TSH travels to the thyroid where it triggers T three and T four release by the thyroid cells. T three and T four increase basal metabolic rate of the body cells and cause a rise in body temperature (the calorigenic effect). T three and T four then feed back to the hypothalamus and inhibits TRH and TSH release. If metabolic rate is high and or T three and T four concentrations are low, then the hypothalamus stops releasing TRH (negative feedback). As a result, the anterior pituitary will not release TSH and no T three or T four will be produced by the thyroid."><image mime-type="image/png" src="../../media/PHA_Figure_27_01_003.png"/></media>

<title>Hypothyroidism</title>
<para id="para-00007"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">Hypothyroidism</term> arises from an inadequate secretion of T3 and T4 into the bloodstream, prompting the pituitary gland to release TSH. This dynamic is part of the hypothalamus-pituitary axis, in which the hypothalamus triggers the release of TRH to stimulate the anterior pituitary in the secretion of TSH. <term id="term-00009">Hashimoto thyroiditis</term> is the most common cause of hypothyroidism. This condition is caused by an autoimmune-mediated destruction of the thyroid gland, which leads to a dysfunctional thyroid gland and decreased secretion of thyroid hormones. If hypothyroidism is left untreated, the client may develop a <term id="term-00010">myxedema coma</term>, which is a life-threatening disorder that leads to hypothermia, cardiovascular collapse, hypoventilation, hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, and coma.</para>
<para id="para-00008">Symptoms of hypothyroidism include the following:</para>

<para id="para-00014"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">Hypoparathyroidism</term> occurs when the body does not secrete enough PTH in the blood.

Hypoparathyroidism is typically caused by an autoimmune disorder, can be idiopathic, or is a result of thyroid/parathyroid surgery.</para>
<para id="para-00015">Symptoms of hypoparathyroidism are tetany, contraction of facial muscles after tapping the facial nerve (<term id="term-00014">Chvostek sign</term>), induction of carpal pedal spasm (<term id="term-00015">Trousseau sign</term>), paresthesia, and a prolonged QT wave (total time from ventricular depolarization to complete repolarization) on an electrocardiogram.
