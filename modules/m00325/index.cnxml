<para id="para-00002">Thanks to advances in technology, improvements in health care services, interventions in public health, and research on the utilization of health services, people are living longer and healthier lives. Much improvement lies in reducing infectious diseases, which were major killers at the turn of the 20th century. U.S. life expectancy increased from 48.3 years for females and 46.3 years for males in 1900 to 79.3 years and 74.1 years, respectively, in 2000. In 2019, Americans’ life expectancy at birth was 81.4 years for females and 76.3 years for males (NCHS, 2023a). Since 2020, however, drops in life expectancy have occurred in the United States. In 2020, life expectancy at birth for women was 79.9 years and dropped further to 79.1 years in 2021. In 2020, life expectancy at birth for men was 74.2 years and dropped to 73.2 years in 2021 (NCHS, 2022b). These declines are largely due to the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">COVID-19</term> pandemic and drug overdose (NCHS, 2022b). Despite this decrease, the country will see continued growth in the older adult population, comprising those aged 65 and over. In 2030, the projected population will be more than twice as large as it was in 2000, growing from 35 million to 73 million and representing 21 percent of the total U.S. population (Federal Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics, 2020). Also of note, nearly one in four older adults in 2019 were members of racial or ethnic minority populations (Administration on Aging, 2021).</para>
<para id="para-00003">As this group lives longer, society must meet their needs. The NCHS (2023d) reported that in 2021, 22.6 percent of noninstitutionalized persons aged 65 and over were in fair or poor health. In 2019, 16.6 percent of people aged 65 and over had one or more hospital stays. According to the American Health Care Association and the National Center for Assisted Living (AHCA/NCAL, 2023), more than 800,000 Americans reside in assisted living communities. The Administration on Aging (2021) indicated that in 2019, only 1.2 million persons (1 percent of persons aged 65–74, 2 percent aged 75–84, and 8 percent aged 85 and over) lived in nursing homes. In 2022, 20.5 percent of men and 26.7 percent of women aged 65 to 74 lived alone, and 23.8 percent of men and 42.5 percent of women aged 75 and over lived alone (United States Census Bureau, 2022). Mechanisms of providing <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">health insurance</term>, supportive environments, healthy communities, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">social safety nets</term>, including health care provision, must be in place. Health promotion and disease prevention are essential parts of maintaining the older adult population’s health and well-being. Older adults must stay informed about healthy lifestyle choices and work with nurses and other health care professionals to create personalized plans for maintaining good health (<link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00325"/>).</para>

<para id="para-00007">Arthritis affects about one in every four adults in the United States. Its prevalence increases with age, and it is more common in women than in men, more common among adults with fair/poor health compared to those with excellent/very good health, and less common among adults who meet physical activity recommendations compared to those who are insufficiently active or inactive (CDC, 2021l). The prevalence of this disease is expected to increase, with projections indicating that an estimated 78.4 million adults will have been diagnosed with arthritis by 2040 (<link target-id="fig-00002" document="m00325"/>) (CDC, 2021l). U.S. adults with arthritis are more likely to be obese or have diabetes or heart disease than those who do not have arthritis. For instance, 28.8 percent of adults who had arthritis in 2016–2018 were also obese, 47 percent of adults who had arthritis in 2013–2015 also had diabetes, and 49 percent of adults who had arthritis in 2013–2015 also had heart disease (CDC, 2022k).</para>

<para id="para-00008">While coronary heart disease and stroke were common in the adult population, diseases of the heart and circulatory vessels are also prevalent in the growing population of older adults. As people age, managing these diseases becomes even more difficult for older adults with comorbidities related to cognition, sleep, physical balance, and strength factors (CDC, 2019a). Myocardial infarction, or a heart attack, occurs when the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a section of heart muscle becomes blocked, leading to a lack of oxygen, which may damage the heart muscle. Angina, a symptom of CAD, is chest pain or discomfort resulting from an area of heart muscle becoming starved of oxygen-rich blood (CDC, 2019a). The prevalence of coronary heart disease in 2019 was 11.4 percent of White people, 10 percent of Black people, 8.8 percent of Hispanic people, and 6.3 percent of Asians and Pacific Islanders. Prevalence was 16.5 percent for those with no high school diploma and 10.9 percent for those with some college or more.</para>

<section id="sect-00004">
<title>Risk Factors Influencing the Health of Older Adults</title>
<para id="para-00009">The older adult population and the adult population share similar risk factors simply due to the similarity of the prevalent illnesses. The Federal Interagency Forum on Aging (2020) considers the following six indicators as health behavior risks: lack of vaccinations, lack of colorectal cancer screenings, poor diet quality, physical inactivity, obesity, and cigarette smoking. In 2018, about 69 percent of older adults reported receiving an influenza vaccine in the past 12 months. This included 72 percent of non-Hispanic White people compared with only 60.4 percent of non-Hispanic Black people and 63 percent of Hispanic people. The percentage of people aged 50 to 75 who received colorectal cancer screenings increased over the last 8 years. Older adults completing the Healthy Eating Index—2015 had their highest component scores in Whole Fruits, Total Protein Foods, and Seafood and Plant Proteins. Their overall diet quality was 64 out of 100. In 2018, only 14 percent of older adults participated in leisure-time physical activity that met the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. The percentage of older adults with obesity increased from 22 percent in 1988–1994 to 30 percent in 2003–2006 and 40 percent in 2015–2018. Finally, the percentage of older adults who were current cigarette smokers has declined, as in 2018, 10 percent of older adult men and 7 percent of older adult women were current smokers (Federal Interagency Forum on Aging, 2020).</para>
<para id="para-00010"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">Polypharmacy</term>, the use of five or more medications, is another risk factor that impacts the health of older adults (WHO, 2019). As the population ages, people are more likely to experience comorbidities that require multiple medications. Older adults are at risk for adverse drug events (ADE) and drug interactions between these multiple medications. The most common ADE in older adults is impaired mobility, which can lead to falls, injuries, or death. Older adults are especially vulnerable due to age-related physiologic changes resulting from the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of drugs. Polypharmacy, in addition to frailty or any other condition that impacts mobility, markedly increases the risk of mortality (Parulekar &amp; Rogers, 2018).</para>
<para id="para-00011"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">Sensory loss</term> issues are another important risk factor for older adults. The senses of hearing, vision, and touch can affect one’s enjoyment of activities and ability to communicate and stay involved with others (MedlinePlus, 2022). Sensory loss issues can also put the older adult at risk for falls, which can lead to injuries or death. Age-related changes in the ear can lead to balance difficulties. Reduced vision may also lead to injuries, and perception related to touch may be impaired, causing difficulties walking related to a reduced ability to perceive where the body is in relation to the floor (Brodkey, 2022). Other difficulties related to touch include a reduced ability to detect pressure, which can lead to pressure ulcers, and a reduced sensitivity to pain, including temperature, which could lead to burns.</para>
<para id="para-00012">A <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">fall risk assessment</term> may benefit older adults in the population health setting. The assessment can check the likelihood of a fall and typically includes an initial screening with questions about overall health, history of previous falls, and current issues with balance, standing, and/or walking. It should also include a set of tasks or fall assessment tools to test the older adult's strength, balance, and gait (MedlinePlus, 2021). One common approach to fall assessment is the use of the CDC’s (2021i) <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">Stopping Elderly Accidents, Deaths, and Injuries (STEADI)</term> approach. STEADI provides screening, assessment, and intervention guidelines. Particular assessments included in STEADI are</para>

<item>Timed Up-and-Go (Tug) test to assess gait,</item>

</list>
<para id="para-00013">The <link url="https://openstax.org/r/steadi">STEADI Resource Algorithm</link> assessment results will illustrate if the older adult has a low, moderate, or high risk of falling and may show which particular areas (gait, strength, and/or balance) should be addressed.</para>
<para id="para-00014">One risk factor for the mental health of older adults is related to their age itself. <term id="term-00013">Ageism</term> is discrimination against older people because of negative and inaccurate stereotyping (Weir, 2023). It is so deep-rooted in American societies that most people ignore this pervasive issue. However, ageism has various negative effects on older adults’ physical and mental well-being. Ageism</para>

<section id="sect-00005">
<title>Educational Interventions to Promote Self-Care in Older Adults</title>
<para id="para-00015"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">Self-care</term> is crucial for the well-being of older adults. Aging-related physical and cognitive changes can make it more difficult to take care of oneself. However, practicing self-care can help older adults maintain their independence, prevent or manage health problems, and improve their overall quality of life (Marques et al., 2019). Self-care practices such as exercise, healthy eating, and proper medication management can help older adults maintain their physical health. Regular physical activity can help prevent chronic diseases, while a healthy diet can provide the nutrients needed to support overall health. Engaging in self-care activities such as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">meditation</term>, socializing, and hobbies can promote mental well-being and reduce the risk of depression and anxiety. Participating in social activities or volunteering can increase social engagement and reduce feelings of isolation or loneliness. Older adults who practice self-care may experience less stress and greater emotional resilience. Self-care practices such as getting enough sleep and managing chronic health conditions can improve cognitive function in older adults. These can help prevent or delay the onset of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">cognitive decline</term> and dementia. Finally, self-care promotes independence for older adults. By taking care of themselves, they can maintain their independence and avoid relying on others for assistance with daily activities.</para>
<para id="para-00016">As with other age groups, health education classes can cover various topics useful for self-care of older adults, including nutrition, exercise, medication management, and stress management. Older adults can also benefit from one-on-one counseling sessions focusing on their self-care needs and goals. During such sessions, a nurse can provide guidance and support on healthy habits, medication adherence, and chronic disease management. Group support programs may also be beneficial, as they provide a sense of community and encouragement. The group may focus on a specific condition or a specific health behavior. Technology-based educational interventions may also be beneficial with older adult populations. Applications used on smartphones or websites may provide information on healthy living or assist in tracking of activities such as sleep or medication management. Finally, nurses may make home visits to older adults to provide education and support regarding self-care practices. This may be particularly useful for those who have limited mobility or live in rural areas.</para>

<title>Healthy People 2030 Goals for Older Adults</title>
<para id="para-00017">The overarching <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">Healthy People 2030</term> goal for older adults is to “improve health and well-being for older adults” (ODPHP, n.d.-f, para. 1). Their prediction is that by 2060, almost a quarter of the U.S. population will be older adults. As such, the focus is on the issues this population experiences related to their health and SDOH.</para>
<note class="healthy-people" id="note-00001">
<title><link url="https://openstax.org/r/olderadults">Older Adults</link></title>
<para id="para-00018">Healthy People 2030 older adult objectives are in a variety of categories and address topics such as physical activity, dementias, foodborne illness, infectious diseases, reduction of hospital admissions (for pressure ulcers, diabetes, urinary tract infections, pneumonia, and asthma), injury prevention related to falls or the use of inappropriate medications, oral conditions, osteoporosis, and age-related macular degeneration vision loss.</para>
</note>
<para id="para-00019">One area focused on by Healthy People 2030 is falls in older adults. One in three fall annually, and falls are a leading cause of injury for this population. ODPHP (n.d.-h) has recognized that physical activity can help older adults prevent chronic diseases and fall-related injuries. Objectives related to increasing the proportion of older adults with physical or cognitive health problems who get physical activity, reducing the proportion of older adults who use inappropriate medications, reducing hip fractures among older adults, and increasing the proportion of older adults who get screened for osteoporosis can help to address falls. Unfortunately, fall-related deaths among older adults is getting worse. In 2018, there were 64.4 deaths per 100,000 population caused by unintentional falls. This increased to 78 deaths per 100,000 population in 2021. The target is a decrease to 63.4 per 100,000 (ODPHP, n.d.-h).</para>

<section id="sect-00007">
<title>Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Activities to Improve the Health of Older Adults</title>
<para id="para-00020">Heath promotion for this population often requires a multidisciplinary approach that includes nurses, other health care professionals, community organizations, and caregivers to ensure older adults receive the support they need to lead to healthy and fulfilling later years of life. As with the adult population, health promotion activities to improve the health of older adults should be geared toward the major diseases that impact this population. Regular physical activity can help older adults maintain a healthy weight, increase their strength and flexibility, reduce their risk of falls, and improve their overall health and well-being. Activities promoting a balanced and healthy diet can also help with healthy weight maintenance, reduce the risk of chronic diseases, and improve overall health. Other health promotion activities that can improve the health of older adults include the following:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00008">
<item>Promoting clients to remain active, independent, and involved in their communities as long as possible</item>
<item>Providing resources to help caregivers of older adults stay healthy and deliver quality care</item>
<item>Providing resources for senior centers in communities</item>
<item>Promoting fall prevention programs in the home and in the community</item>
<item>Promoting maintenance of appointments with providers for medical management of chronic conditions</item>
</list>
<para id="para-00021">One example of a health promotion activity that takes place nationwide is <link url="https://openstax.org/r/silversneakers">SilverSneakers</link> (Tivity Health, 2023). This fitness program is available for older adults enrolled in Medicare Advantage Plans (Part C) at over 17,000 locations. Some locations include national gym franchises, community centers, and senior centers. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">SilverSneakers</term> also offers online workout videos for those who prefer to work out at home or are homebound. Classes range from balance and stability lessons and gentle stretches to Pilates, cardio and strength, line dancing, and kickboxing. Yoga, mindfulness, meditation sessions, and a fitness application for smartphone use are also offered. Daily tips on the SilverSneakers blog provide information on nutrition, diseases and conditions that impact older adults, and physical activity tips.</para>
<para id="para-00022">As some older adults rely on caregivers for assistance, they are essential members of public health care and should not be ignored. While caregivers can be hired to provide care, informal or unpaid caregivers provide a substantial portion of long-term care in homes across the United States. These are unpaid family members or friends who are typically middle-aged or older adults helping with another person’s social or health needs. These may include assisting with activities of daily living, helping to manage a chronic disease or disability, paying bills, shopping, providing transportation, or providing emotional support. Caregivers may initially have few responsibilities, but as the needs of the recipient of care increase, additional responsibilities may increase, leading to a strain on the caregiver. The need for caregivers has grown throughout the years, and with an increasing older adult population and the needs that come with this aging, the need for caregivers will grow even more. The CDC (2019b) indicated that there were seven potential family caregivers per older adult, but by 2030, it is predicted that there will only be four potential family caregivers per older adult. This leads caregiving to be an important public health issue.</para>
<para id="para-00023">According to the CDC (2019b), 22.3 percent of adults reported providing care or assistance to a friend or family member in the past 30 days. Among adults aged 45 to 64 years, 24.4 percent are caregivers, compared to 18.8 percent of adults aged 65 years and over. One in four (25.4 percent) women are caregivers, compared to one in five (18.9 percent) men. Black people comprised the largest percentage of caregivers (24.3 percent), followed closely by White people (23.1 percent), then 17.9 percent of Hispanic people and 10.2 percent of Asians/Pacific Islanders. One in three caregivers provided 20 or more hours per week of care, and over half have provided care or assistance for 2 years or longer.</para>
<para id="para-00024">Caregiving can provide great satisfaction and strengthen relationships between families and friends. It can also negatively affect the caregiver’s ability to work, engage in social interactions and relationships, and maintain good physical and mental health (CDC, 2019b). Careful consideration of the physical and mental burden on caregivers is necessary. Therefore, health promotion and disease prevention of older adults must be geared to the recipient of care and the caregiver. The CDC (2019b) recommends the following for health care professionals engaging in health promotion and disease prevention of the older adult population:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00009">
<item>Increase messaging regarding the important role of caregivers and the importance of maintaining their health and well-being</item>
<item>Educate about the importance of caregiving before caregivers begin</item>
<item>Provide caregivers with resources and supports</item>
<item>Be mindful of the health risks for caregivers, encourage them to use available information and tools, and make referrals to supportive programs and services as applicable</item>
<item>Assist with caregiver training and support programs</item>
<item>Advocate for awareness of and access to evidence-based programs and services that can help caregivers and care recipients</item>
<item>Encourage caregivers to get regular checkups, use preventive services, and engage in self-care to maintain their physical and mental health</item>
<item>Ensure that caregivers with a disability and/or chronic disease have access to self-management programs to maintain their health (para. 13)</item>
</list>
<para id="para-00025">Along with providing education and support for caregivers, population health nurses must be alert to the issue of potential elder abuse. <term id="term-00019">Elder abuse</term> is an intentional act or failure to act that causes or creates a risk of harm to an older adult and occurs in about 1 in 10 people aged 60 and older who live at home (CDC, 2021g). The abuse occurs at the hands of a caregiver or a person the elder trusts, and it can involve physical, sexual, emotional or psychological, or financial abuse; neglect; or a combination of these (see <link target-id="table-00001" document="m00325"/>). Prevention of elder abuse can begin by understanding and addressing the factors that put them at risk for or protect them from violence.

<para id="para-00026">Evidence-based practice is important to health promotion and disease prevention for older adults. While the Institute for Healthcare Improvement’s (IHI, 2023) Age-Friendly Health System initiative was designed originally for hospital and clinical settings, population health nurses can also use the concepts. In the video “The Key Components of Age-Friendly Care,” Dr. Mary Tinetti, Chief of Geriatrics at the Yale School of Medicine and Yale-New Haven Hospital, describes the components of an age-friendly health system.</para>

<title>Primary Prevention</title>
<para id="para-00028"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020">Primary prevention</term> for older adults involves strategies to prevent the onset of disease or injury. These strategies are typically focused on maintaining the health of healthy older adults and preventing the development of chronic diseases and frailty. Examples of primary prevention (Lenartowicz, 2022) include the following:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00018">
<item>Immunizations, such as the influenza, pneumococcal, tetanus, and zoster vaccines</item>
<item>Chemoprevention using aspirin for the prevention of coronary heart disease and stroke, if applicable</item>
<item>Lifestyle changes, such as smoking cessation, avoidance of trans fats, increased intake of fruits and vegetables, moderate physical activity, adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, limited caffeine intake, and limited alcohol intake</item>
<item>Specific recommendations for prevention of frailty including exercise and a low-fat, reduced sodium, high-calcium, high-fiber diet with calcium and vitamin D supplements</item>

<title>Secondary Prevention</title>
<para id="para-00029"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00021">Secondary prevention</term> of disease in the older adult population aims to detect and treat disease or its complications early, before symptoms or functional losses occur. An older adult may have minimal or no chronic disease but require secondary prevention. The primary method of secondary prevention is screening. Multiple organizations publish screening guidelines, which can differ. The following are Medicare-covered preventive service guidelines for older adults (Highmark, 2023b):</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00019">
<item>Weight, height, and BMI monitoring annually</item>
<item>Blood pressure screening annually</item>
<item>Lipid panel every five years or as clinically indicated</item>
<item>Fasting plasma glucose in those who are overweight or obese annually</item>
<item><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00022">Mammography</term> every 1 to 2 years until age 75</item>
<item>Chlamydia and gonorrhea screening for older women who are at increased risk for infection</item>
<item>Syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis B screening for those at increased risk for infection</item>
<item>Hepatitis C screening</item>
<item>Colorectal cancer screening until age 75</item>
<item>Bone mineral density screening of women aged 65 to 69 years and men aged 70 years and over every 2 years</item>
<item>Prostate cancer screening for men aged 55 to 69 years, if clinically indicated</item>
<item>Lung cancer screening for those aged 50 to 80 years who have a 20 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years</item>
</list>
<para id="para-00030">Another secondary prevention important for older adults is screening for fall risk. In particular, older adults who are at risk of falling or those who may have fallen in the past should be screened. As mentioned previously, the CDC’s (2023h) <link url="https://openstax.org/r/cdcsteadi">STEADI Inithttps://www.cdc.gov/steadi/index.htmliative</link> provides a coordinated approach for nurses and other health care providers to implement the practice guideline for fall prevention.

<note class="client-teaching" id="note-00003">
<title>Environmental Safety for Older Adults</title>
<para id="para-00031">The community health nurse should teach older adults or their caregivers to do the following:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00020">
<item>Keep emergency numbers at hand, including 911, poison control, a family member or friend’s number to call in case of emergency, and the health care provider’s office number.</item>
<item>Consider a special alarm that can be worn as a bracelet or necklace. The button can be pushed in case of a fall, and emergency services will be notified.</item>
<item>Try not to rush to answer the phone, carry a cordless or cell phone when moving around the home, or let an answering machine pick up messages.</item>
<item>Wear nonslip footwear, such as slippers with rubber/no-slip bottoms or flat, thin-soled shoes that fit well.</item>

<para id="para-00033"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00023">Depression</term> screening is also important in identifying social isolation in older adults. If clients feel lonely or isolated, they may benefit from assistance in increasing social contacts to prevent morbidity. Those who are depressed warrant appropriate intervention. Older adults should be encouraged to remain as productive as possible, engage in leisure activities, and maintain a sense of social connectedness in order to help prevent psychosocial problems and physical disability (Lenartowicz, 2022).</para>

<title>Tertiary Prevention</title>
<para id="para-00034"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">Tertiary prevention</term> is designed to manage an existing, symptomatic, and typically chronic disease to prevent further functional loss. Older adults with the following chronic disorders can potentially benefit from tertiary prevention:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00021">
<item>Arthritis to prevent progression or falls</item>
<item><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00025">Osteoporosis</term> to prevent progression or fractures</item>
<item>Diabetes to prevent retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, coronary artery disease, and foot ulcers or amputation</item>

<title>Integration of Sociocultural and Linguistically Responsive Interventions for Older Adults</title>
<para id="para-00036">Integrating sociocultural and linguistically responsive interventions for older adults promotes health equity and improves health outcomes. This section has described the older adult population's diverse ethnic backgrounds and recognized that health disparities exist among older adults, such as high rates of chronic diseases, particularly among older adults from certain racial and ethnic backgrounds. Access to care is often also impacted. While <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">social isolation</term> may be a significant concern for many older adults, it is particularly difficult for those from cultural minority groups. Additionally, older adults or their caregivers may have unique health needs related to their cultural backgrounds. By integrating sociocultural and linguistically responsive interventions, nurses can better address the needs of this population, improving their health outcomes and quality of life.</para>
<section id="sect-00012">
<title>Sociocultural Interventions</title>
<para id="para-00037">It is recognized that social connections and supports are essential for healthy aging, but these may be affected by the sociocultural environment, particularly a community’s values and beliefs. Howell (2020) performed a study to examine the relationship between the sociocultural factors that shape diet, physical activity, and nutritional status outcomes among Alaska Native and African American Alaskan older adults. The study found that diet and physical activity practices of participants did not meet national recommendations. Howell (2020) also found that incorporating friends in interventions led to increased energy expenditure in participants and family members influenced increased fruit consumption. Participation in cultural social events increased participants’ intake of fats and sweets. The media was found to be a strong influencer of participants’ behavior, as 85.4 percent reported daily television watching, and was recommended as a way to reach older adults with socioculturally responsive programs to alleviate some of the barriers to healthy diet and exercise (Howell, 2020).</para>
<para id="para-00038"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029">Pain</term> is also an issue that older adults frequently experience. Reis et al. (2022) described the importance of recognizing cultural factors’ influence on how individuals perceive, respond, communicate, and manage pain. Due to this, pain education should be provided using different culturally appropriate examples, metaphors, images, and delivery methods that may best enhance the impact of the message. They found that a culturally sensitive educational session should consider that clients will require a good communicator who will listen to their concerns, recognize the legitimacy of their pain, and respect their culture, values, and preferences. Failure to do this will negatively impact the educational session. A client’s belief about pain should be assessed, as these may range from pain being a normal part of aging to being a punishment from a higher power for bad deeds. Reis et al. (2022) recommend using several different audiovisual aids, including those that can be taken home to share with friends and family.</para>

<section id="sect-00013">
<title>Linguistically Responsive Interventions</title>
<para id="para-00039"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00030">Language barriers</term> can limit access to health care in any population. Older adults who speak a language other than English may face language barriers that limit their ability to understand their disease or even access health care services. The National Council on Aging (2022) spotlighted a senior center in Nebraska that served seniors with language barriers. The Intercultural Senior Center (ISC) included refugees who had language and cultural barriers. There are over 15 languages spoken at the center, including Spanish, Korean, Nepali, Karenni, and Burmese. Staff at ISC include people from at least 10 different nations on three continents who speak several different languages. Specific services include linguistic and cultural accessibility, access to and navigation of legal and health services, transportation, and social engagement (National Council on Aging, 2022).</para>

<title>Chapter Summary</title>
<para id="para-00040">As the older adult population continues to grow and many live independently, it is imperative that population health nurses implement health promotion and disease prevention interventions to address their health care needs. This includes establishing supportive environments, healthy communities, and social safety nets as health care is provided. Health promotion and disease prevention play vital roles in maintaining the well-being and quality of life for older adults. Older adults must stay informed about healthy lifestyle choices in conjunction with any disease processes they may also be experiencing and collaborate with nurses and other health care professionals to develop personalized plans for maintaining good health.</para>
