<title>Opioid Antitussives</title>
<para id="para-00002"><term id="term-00001">Antitussives</term> are drugs that are used to treat nonproductive coughs. They are more commonly referred to as cough suppressants. Although their exact mechanism of action is unknown, it is thought that these medications inhibit the cough center in the brain or soothe nerve receptors around airways to reduce transmission of cough signals to the brain. Antitussives are not recommended for productive coughs where the client is coughing up mucus due to the infection risk that can result from the buildup of mucus in the respiratory system. Many antitussives are available over the counter, but there are a few that are prescription only (Sison, 2022).</para>
<para id="para-00003"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">Opioid antitussives</term> are very effective and are thought to act centrally in the brain stem as well as on sensory nerve endings in the airways. The main concern with opioid antitussives is the potential for dependence, respiratory depression, and gastrointestinal issues such as constipation. Due to the opioid component, addiction is a concern, as is overdose of the drug.</para>
<section id="sect-00003">
<title>Codeine/Guaifenesin</title>
<para id="para-00004">Codeine/guaifenesin is an opioid drug that is very effective as an antitussive, or cough suppressant. The drug works by suppressing the cough reflex through direct action on the cough center in the medulla. Because it contains codeine, which is an opioid, there is concern about adverse effects such as respiratory depression and dependence (MedlinePlus, 2023).</para>
<section id="sect-00004">
<title>Adverse Effects and Contraindications</title>
<para id="para-00005">Opioid antitussives can cause drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, and hypotension. Dependence is also a concern due to the opioid portion. Those who are hypersensitive to them should avoid their use. Clients with angle-closure glaucoma, pyloric stenosis, peptic ulcer disease, and prostatic hyperplasia should also avoid opioid antitussives.</para>

<title>Nonopioid Antitussives</title>
<para id="para-00007"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">Nonopioid antitussives</term> are antitussives that do not contain an opioid component. Because of the lack of an opioid, there are no opioid-related side effects. These drugs work by numbing the throat and suppressing the cough. Drowsiness, dizziness, headache, and trouble sleeping are common side effects of these drugs.</para>

<title>Benzonatate</title>
<para id="para-00008">Benzonatate is a nonopioid antitussive that works by reducing the cough reflex in the airways and lungs. The drug comes as a capsule, taken orally. Clients should discuss with their health care provider any medications they are currently taking and inform the provider immediately if they experience rash, itching, or confusion because these are adverse effects (MedlinePlus, 2017).</para>

<para id="para-00009">Dextromethorphan acts to suppress cough by acting on the cough center in the medulla. This drug is a common choice for relief of cough because it does not cause addiction and has little to no CNS depression.
