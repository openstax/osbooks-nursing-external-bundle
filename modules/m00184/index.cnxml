<para id="para-00002">A common idea is that a community consists of the residents of a certain town or city—a geographic definition. More broadly, however, a <term id="term-00001">community</term> is defined as a group of people with at least one characteristic in common. The characteristic may be a place, a personal attribute, or a common goal. Within each community, there will be individuals with health problems and health risks, some of which may be individual, meaning the rest of the community does not face similar circumstances. For example, a person who smokes or lives in a home with smokers will face increased respiratory health risks compared to a person who does not smoke or live with smokers. A person who does not wear sunscreen will have an increased risk of skin cancer compared to a person who applies sunscreen daily. However, every community may house a common health condition or shared health <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">risk</term>. For example, a community situated near a factory that disposes of its toxic chemicals in the water supply will share the risks of consuming contaminated drinking water. Similarly, residents of a city that provides automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in high-traffic public places may have a better chance of surviving a cardiac event than those with no accessible AEDs.</para>
<para id="para-00003">In population- or community-based nursing, nurses work to address a community’s collective health instead of individual health needs. Recall the chapter’s opening scenario. Try to list five communities that Elsa belongs to.</para>

<title>Community Attributes</title>
<para id="para-00004">Formal and informal communities exist within and across towns and cities. A community may comprise people who celebrate the same cultural holidays or people who are at risk for the same health condition.</para>
<para id="para-00005">Consider the many communities that may be present in a classroom of nursing students: a community of students, a clinical team, a study group, students with children, and perhaps students studying nursing as a new career. Elsa, from the chapter’s opening scenario, is a member of numerous communities, including residents of the town, people with type 1 diabetes mellitus, high school students who are gender <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">nonconforming</term>, the soccer team, and residents who get around on bikes, among others. Communities of nursing clients may consist of those who inhabit a specific geographic location, share specific characteristics, or access the same social systems. Communities may also form when groups cannot access select health services and social systems.</para>
<para id="para-00006">Individuals do not have to live within mapped boundaries to be part of a geographic community. People who work, worship, or play in an area where they do not live can be interested in that community's health.</para>
<para id="para-00007">A key activity for geographic communities is <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">civic engagement</term>—involvement in issues of public concern through political and nonpolitical processes that increase community vitality, challenge injustices, and address social problems (<link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00184"/>) (American Psychological Association, 2009; Wray-Lake &amp; Abrams, 2020). Other geographically based communities include members of community centers, such as a Council on Aging or a Boys and Girls Club, and populations of school students, home caregivers, and teachers in a geographic community.</para>

<caption>Protest is a form of civic engagement. Protests can inform members of the public of issues, mobilize voters and community members to act for change, and influence the policy process.

<title>Social Media and Other Social Systems</title>
<para id="para-00011"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">Social media</term> and other social systems provide avenues for the formation and definition of communities. Social and political networks may serve as a basis for uniting as a community for health change. Technology has dramatically enhanced opportunities to join a community, as many people use <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">social networks</term> to participate in civic engagement, learn about health, effect change through sharing stories and knowledge, and organize to advocate for policies and societal changes that advance health. Social media has increased the visibility of community health issues, as community members and advocates can quickly share information with people around the globe.</para>
<para id="para-00012"><term id="term-00013">Advocacy</term> in the context of community health refers to support for a specific health cause or recommendations for community and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">policy change</term>. Advocacy is a significant health promotion strategy to inform voters and policymakers of pressing community health issues and the consequences of harmful policies or inaction (Jackson et al., 2021). Community members who share their own health experiences, encourage the forming of community, as other members who identify with the experiences or want to support health change can join the conversation and become involved. Social media has provided a platform for community members, clinicians, organizations, charities, and others to connect and work together to improve the <term id="term-00015">dimensions of community health</term> in many areas. Health <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">advocates</term> have used social media to call attention to, and impact change for, many issues across the globe, such as alcohol use in the Netherlands, tobacco control in Australia, sexual harassment in Egypt, traffic accidents in Ireland, maternal mortality in the United States, and housing in New Zealand (Albalawi &amp; Sixsmith, 2015; Bekkers et al., 2011; Chisholm &amp; O’Sullivan, 2017; Hefler et al., 2013; Behm et al., 2022; Peuchaud, 2014). <link document="m00360">Advocating for Population Health</link> covers nurse advocacy in more detail.</para>

<title>Social Media and Community Health Change</title>
<para id="para-00013">Communities have worked to generate health change through social media messaging and campaigns. Over the last few years, many social media movements have raised awareness of select health issues, changed public perception of health problems, and even successfully advocated for policy change in companies and organizations or for greater society through changes to public law. For example, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">#MeToo</term> movement that went viral in 2017 contributed to the United States Congress passing of the Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights.

<title>Community Assessments and Profiles</title>
<para id="para-00016"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">Assessment</term> is the first and most important step of the nursing process. Nurses cannot address a problem if they do not know it exists, and they cannot support a health behavior or community effort if they do not realize it is occurring.</para>
<para id="para-00017">Assessment begins with gathering data. Nurses may take several approaches to gathering data. First, they may conduct a <term id="term-00019">windshield survey</term>. In a windshield survey, nurses explore a community or neighborhood and observe on foot, from a bench or street corner, or through the windows of a vehicle (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010). Observations made via this type of survey can alert nurses to urgent or potential health risks in the community, as observers may notice the condition of sidewalks and public spaces, community noise levels, street access and activity, and the presence or absence of businesses and places of employment. Please see <link document="m00374">Appendix A</link> for an example of a windshield survey template that nurses may use to conduct one of these assessments. Per the University of Kansas Center for Community Health and Development <link url="https://openstax.org/r/ctbku">Community Tool Box</link> (2023), during such a survey, nurses should observe:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00004">

</list>
<para id="para-00018">Regardless of the method, they use to conduct a windshield survey nurses should conduct the survey in pairs or groups. First, it is unsafe to attempt to drive and note observations at the same time. Additionally, each nurse may have different observations, which can add to the richness of data collected. Nurses may also collect data from open sources in the community, such as publicly available reports, census data, and other public documents (Quinn et al., 2019). For example, department of health reports regarding the rates of communicable illnesses and chronic conditions can help elucidate a community’s health needs, and the posted minutes of a local select board meeting can illuminate health topics on the minds of local community partners and residents. See <link document="m00187">Assessment, Analysis, and Diagnosis</link> for more information regarding community data sources. Finally, nurses should consult key community partners, policymakers, community leaders, and community members during a community assessment.</para>

<para id="para-00020">Including community members in community-based nursing work is essential and should start from the earliest stages of a community initiative. Involving community members’ perspectives and participation supports not only thorough assessments and meaningful change but also ethical practice. Meaningful <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00023">partnerships</term> with community members show respect for the community, build trust and relationships, minimize risk and burden, build legitimacy, and positively impact health (Adhikari et al., 2020; Haldane et al., 2019).</para> 
<para id="para-00021">Community inclusion also helps nurses work against both the narrative and the reality that clinicians often tell people what to do without considering personal, contextual, social, or other factors. Such actions may be perceived as patronizing and marginalizing the community, or treating them as insignificant and making them feel powerless or unimportant. In nursing, <term id="term-00024">decolonization</term> refers to processes that systematically dismantle “western colonial ideologies of superiority, thought, approaches, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00025">privilege</term>” (Fontenot &amp; McMurray, 2020, p. 272). Partnering with members of a community is in alignment with decolonization and can contribute to community interventions that are robust, respectful, culturally responsive, and inclusive (Lin et al., 2020; McCreedy et al., 2018).</para>

<title>Colonialism in Nursing</title>
<para id="para-00022"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00027">Colonialism</term> is an ideology with a strong foundation of control and influence. Nursing students may remember learning about colonists in the contexts of history, war, and geography during primary and secondary school. Depending on the country in which a nursing student attended primary and secondary school, colonists and colonialism may have been depicted as a positive story of starting a new life. However, the reality is that colonists invaded, conquered, occupied, dominated, and exploited the lands of other people. Colonialism and racism, the unfair treatment of individuals based on race, share these harmful foundations. Colonialism and racism are both present in nursing; power dynamics, forced dependency, lack of self-determination, and othering shape nursing education, research, and practice as well as health policy. While there are many steps that nurses must take individually and collectively to confront racism and colonialism in the discipline, one step relevant to community health is to ensure meaningful community participation in community assessments and population health program planning.</para>

<para id="para-00024">One method of structuring a community assessment and organizing the resulting data is through <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">Gordon’s functional health patterns</term> (Gordon, 1982). Nurse theorist Marjory Gordon developed the functional health patterns to guide nurses through a thorough assessment of individual clients and families (Gordon, 1982). However, the functional health patterns can also be applied to a community assessment. Ten years after Gordon published her work, nurse scholars Nancy Kriegler and Marilyn Harton used it to develop the Community Health Assessment Tool (Kriegler &amp; Harton, 1992). See <link target-id="table-00001" document="m00184"/> for descriptions of the 11 functional health patterns for use in community assessments and the items nurses may assess in each pattern.</para>

<para id="para-00028">Think back to the chapter’s opening scenario. As you get to know Elsa, they share more about the community and their friends with you. You learn that their active schedule does not leave much time for rest, and the same is true for their friends, who also balance jobs, sports, and schoolwork. Elsa sometimes has difficulty fitting it all in each week while getting enough sleep. They also talk about having trouble sleeping during the summer, as seasonal residents and vacationers can be pretty noisy. Elsa feels that they have a manageable workload this week, as the soccer season is over, none of their babysitting clients have called, and their only major homework is a health class assignment on sexually transmitted infections. They share that the high school students have a health class meeting every other week, where they discuss health topics such as contraception, exercise, substance use, and relationship safety. Elsa appreciates the school community, which is inclusive and fosters a sense of belonging for the most part, although some students say they don’t believe people can have diverse sexual orientation or gender identities, and Elsa wonders if some classmates purposefully misgender them. But the classmates who may be doing this are few, and Elsa’s friend group spans all grades, genders, sports, interests, and other characteristics. Elsa thinks your community assessment is interesting, but they are running late to meet up with their friends at the town square for the annual Green Living Festival, which they describe as a giant yard sale of secondhand clothing and household items. The goal of the festival is for these used goods to be repurposed and stay out of the county landfill.</para>

<para id="para-00029">When the community is the client, nurses address the community’s collective health instead of the acute and chronic health needs of individual clients. Community health nurses focus on promoting health, reducing risk, ameliorating disparities, and increasing equity. Communities may consist of groups of residents in a geographic area or groups of people sharing common characteristics. Nurses use many approaches such as windshield surveys, to identify community health risks. Nurses should also consult public reports and other open information sources and interview community partners, decision-makers, and community members to ensure accurate assessments and meaningful data, and ethical practice. Partnerships with community members build trust, convey respect, minimize risk, and contribute to positive health outcomes. Inclusive practices in community-based work align with the concept of decolonization in nursing.</para>
