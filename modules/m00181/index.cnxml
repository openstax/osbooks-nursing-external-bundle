  <para id="para-00002">Various theories and models support the practice of health promotion and disease prevention. These theoretical bases guide the identification, development, and implementation of interventions. In many cases, they explain how health behaviors are influenced or how to influence health behaviors (Rejeski &amp; Fanning, 2019). As such, they are commonly called <emphasis effect="italics">behavior change theories</emphasis> and are geared toward individual health behaviors. However, it is also necessary to look at health promotion from a systems level to encompass the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">holistic</term> nature of health and all the factors that impact health, or the SDOH, as discussed previously.</para>

  <title>Applying a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">Systems Perspective</term> to Health Promotion</title>
  <para id="para-00003">There are different levels of influence that can affect health behavior. Recall Deanna in the case scenario. After receiving the blood pressure reading at the community health <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">screening</term>, Deanna may delay going to her provider for an annual exam. At the intrapersonal (individual) level, Deanna may have been stressed about the blood pressure reading, which she knows may increase her blood pressure even more, so this inaction may be due to fears of what the exam will reveal. At the interpersonal level, Deanna’s friends like to engage in regular exercise. This would be a positive factor, encouraging Deanna to participate in healthy activities. At the institutional level, scheduling an appointment may be difficult due to limited office hours. At the public policy level, Deanna may lack insurance coverage and have difficulty affording the appointment’s cost. The outcome of the individual avoiding an annual exam and potentially negatively affecting their health may result from every level of influence.</para>

  <section id="sect-00004">
  <title>Individual or Intrapersonal Level</title>
  <para id="para-00006">The individual level is the most basic level of health promotion and disease prevention. Individual behavior is the most fundamental unit of group behavior; therefore, individual-level (intrapersonal-level) influence is necessary to promote behavior change at the larger levels. <term id="term-00008">Intrapersonal-level</term> theories focus on intrapersonal factors, which exist or occur within the individual self or mind. These factors include knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, motivation, self-concept, developmental history, past experiences, and skills.</para>
  <para id="para-00007">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">Health Belief Model (HBM)</term> focuses on an individual’s perceptions of the threat that a health problem poses, the benefits of avoiding the threat, and the factors that influence the decision to act. The threat could relate to susceptibility or severity, and factors influencing the decision to act could involve barriers, cues to action, or self-efficacy. One of the first theories of health behavior, the HBM was developed in the 1950s through the U.S. Public Health Service to explain why so few people were participating in free, government-supported programs to prevent and detect disease. The HBM (National Cancer Institute, 2005, p. 13) indicates that an individual is ready to act regarding their health if six constructs are in place (see <link target-id="table-00001" document="m00181"/>).</para>
  <para id="para-00008">The six constructs provide a beneficial framework for designing short-term and long-term behavior change strategies in individuals. They can also be used to design or adapt health promotion or disease prevention programs for groups. The HBM may be used alone or in combination with other theories or models.</para>

  <para id="para-00009">Another theory that can be used at the intrapersonal level for health promotion and prevention is the Stages of Change, or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">Transtheoretical, Model</term>. This model is based on the premise that behavior change is a process, not an event, and as a person attempts to change a behavior, they move through five stages: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance. For more on these stages, see <link document="m00151">Socio-Ecological Perspectives and Health</link>. An example of how this model may be applied is the CDC (2017) fact sheet “<link url="https://openstax.org/r/cdcgovsteadi">Talking about Fall Prevention with Your Patients</link>” that describes strategies for matching fall prevention advice to a client’s stage of readiness.</para>

  <title>Interpersonal Level</title>
  <para id="para-00011">At the interpersonal level, “theories of health behavior assume individuals exist within, and are influenced by, a social environment” (National Cancer Institute, 2005, p. 19). The social environment can include anyone with whom an individual interacts, such as family, friends, coworkers, health professionals, and others. The opinions, thoughts, behaviors, advice, and support of these people influence the individual’s feelings and behavior, and the individual has an equal effect on these people.</para>
  <para id="para-00012">The <term id="term-00017">Social Cognitive Theory</term> (SCT) is the most frequently used example of an interpersonal model. SCT describes the influence of experiences, actions of others, and environmental factors on an individual’s health behaviors. Three main factors that affect the likelihood that a person will change a health behavior, according to the SCT, are self-efficacy, goals, and outcome expectancies. SCT includes six constructs, described in <link target-id="table-00002" document="m00181"/>.</para>

  <title>Community Level</title>
  <para id="para-00015">Communities are at the heart of public health promotion and disease prevention. Community-level models explore how social systems function and change and how to activate community members and organizations. Models using community-level strategies can be used in numerous settings, including health care institutions, schools, workplaces, community groups, and government agencies. These models use the ecological perspective, as described in <link document="m00151">Socio-Ecological Perspectives and Health</link>, addressing individual, group, institutional, and community issues (National Cancer Institute, 2005).</para>

  <para id="para-00017">Diffusion of Innovations as it relates to health promotion and disease prevention requires a multilevel change process. At the individual or intrapersonal level, adopting a health behavior innovation usually involves lifestyle change.

At the community level, the media, policies, or beginning initiatives may be involved. Several factors (see <link target-id="table-00004" document="m00181"/>) determine how quickly and to what extent an innovation will be adopted and diffused.

  <para id="para-00019">The Diffusion of Innovations Theory combines all of these elements to guide the health care professional in providing health promotion and disease prevention efforts. For example, a local university designs a program for the county public school system to decrease obesity in elementary school students. In the classroom, students learn about healthy foods, nutrition, and reading nutrition labels. The school cafeteria provides sample lunch menus with nutrition information. In physical education classes, students learn how different physical activities contribute to healthy living. After a few years, the program is considered a success. Program participants continued to have healthier habits than children who graduated before the program began.</para>
  <para id="para-00020">The program’s success, however, is not enough. To broaden its impact, diffusion is necessary. The program’s <emphasis effect="italics">relative advantage</emphasis> could be demonstrated to other school district leaders. The program’s <emphasis effect="italics">compatibility</emphasis> could be demonstrated by illustrating how it meets national and state standards for health and physical education. <emphasis effect="italics">Complexity</emphasis> could be addressed with teaching toolkits that make content easily accessible to educators. Interested educators could access free sample teaching materials via a website for <emphasis effect="italics">trialability</emphasis>. Finally, <emphasis effect="italics">observability</emphasis> could be provided via a video on the same website for demonstration purposes. Once adopted by another school district, leadership at the district could use the categories of adopters to roll out the program to educators.</para>

  <para id="para-00021">Nurses and other health care professionals need frameworks to support the practice of health promotion and disease prevention. Various levels of such frameworks are necessary in order to provide appropriate guidance. The ecological perspective is an overarching approach to both health promotion and disease prevention at the systems level. The CDC developed its socio-ecological model from the ecological perspective as a framework for its health promotion programs. A variety of theories and models exist at the individual (intrapersonal), interpersonal, and community levels.
