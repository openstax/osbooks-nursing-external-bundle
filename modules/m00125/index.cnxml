<para id="para-00001">Michael is a public health nurse who works at a free clinic in the community where he grew up and still lives. The community Michael’s clinic serves includes a large <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">immigrant</term> population as well as a high percentage of older adults. A consortium of local clinics in Michael’s area recently received a grant from the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">Health Services and Resources Administration</term> (HRSA)—which operates under the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</term> (HHS)—to work toward increasing the number of minorities who receive care at these local clinics. As a participant in the consortium, Michael prepared a flyer about the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">free clinic</term>. The clinic has been recruiting nurses that represent <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">minority ethnic groups</term> in the community, so Michael included photos of the diverse staff to help increase trust in the clinic’s health care. As a public health nurse, Michael has the opportunity to improve access to health care and nutrition resources for his community.</para>
