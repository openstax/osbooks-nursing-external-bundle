<title>Regulations and Recommendations for the Use of Supplements</title>
<para id="para-00002">Eating a diet with fresh and minimally processed foods is the best source of vitamins and minerals. However, even people with healthy eating habits sometimes need help to bridge occasional nutrient gaps, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">supplements</term> may help.</para>
<para id="para-00003">Deciding on the right <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">vitamin-mineral supplement</term> can be difficult, considering that hundreds of different types are available and no real guidance is provided at the point of sale (NIH, 2018). With almost 60 percent (Mishra et al., 2021) of the population taking multiple vitamin and mineral supplements, guidance is important. Certain people are more likely to need a supplement including those with the following characteristics (Weyh et al., 2022):</para>

<para id="para-00004">Broadly, vitamin-mineral supplements are divided into three main groups: basic, high-potency, and specialized (<link target-id="table-00001" document="m00015"/>). Examples of when each group would apply include the following:</para>

<caption>Categories of Vitamin and Mineral Supplements (source: NIH, 2023a)</caption>

<para id="para-00005">Vitamin-mineral supplements fall under the regulatory powers of the FDA. However, the weak regulation and the vast array of supplements can confuse the consumer. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA)</term> of 1994 altered the FDA’s authority to regulate dietary supplements (NIH Office of Dietary Supplements, 1994). Under DSHEA, the FDA does not authorize or evaluate dietary supplements for safety or effectiveness before reaching store shelves; unfortunately, this makes a “buyer beware” situation. Vitamin manufacturers can lawfully introduce <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">dietary supplements</term> without even notifying the FDA. Since DSHEA was enacted, the dietary supplement market has exploded, with the number of products multiplying nearly 20 times since 1994 (FDA, 2022).</para>

<caption>Examples of Vitamins and Minerals Found in Common Food Sources (Note that all of the above-mentioned foods contain multiple vitamins and minerals.)</caption>

<para id="para-00008">According to the National Institute of Health (NIH-National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, 2018), supplement manufacturers can make three health-related claims on their labels:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00005">
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Health</emphasis>—describes a relationship between a food, food component, or dietary supplement ingredient and reducing the risk of a specific disease or health-related condition</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Nutrient</emphasis>—describes the relative amount of a nutrient or dietary substance in a product</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Structure or function</emphasis>—describes how a product may affect the organs or systems of the body and cannot mention any specific disease</item>
</list>
<para id="para-00009">The dosage of specific vitamin and mineral supplements a client should consume will vary because the <term id="term-00005">Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)</term> differs based on age and sex. For example, note the differences in recommended daily iron intake for each of these groups:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00006">
<item>Adolescent (age 12 to 18 years) female: 15 mg</item>
<item>Adolescent (age 12 to 18 years) male: 11 mg</item>
<item>Adult (age 18 plus years) female: 18 mg</item>
<item>Adult (age 18 plus years) male: 8 mg</item>
</list>
<para id="para-00010">Because of specific needs, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">vitamin-mineral supplements</term> are customized and marketed to population segments based on activity and age. For example, vitamins for children sport bright and catchy labels, gummy textures, and fruity tastes. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">Prenatal vitamins</term> often have labels with pastel colors. Supplements for older adults are packaged in silver labeled bottles. Vitamin-mineral supplements can also be found as liquid drinks, including water, milk, and coffee.</para>
<para id="para-00011">Clients may ask if they need a vitamin-mineral supplement. There is little scientific support for taking a vitamin-mineral supplement when no deficiency signs and symptom exist (Seres, 2023); foods provide many vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals and are more bioavailable than those found in supplements (Harguth, 2022). In some situations, vitamin-mineral supplements are essential for good health, but promoting food as the first line of health defense is strongly supported by science and health professionals.</para>

<section id="sect-00004">
<title>Recommended Dietary Allowance</title>
<para id="para-00012">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">RDAs</term> are published by the Food and National Academies of Sciences every five to 10 years. RDAs were developed during World War II for nutritional guidance in feeding soldiers and food relief in the U.S. and internationally. They were set at the minimum level for good health and not every nutrient has an RDA (Murphy et al., 2016). The nutrients listed in the RDA are used as a goal for healthy individuals at every age. They are preventative in nature and not meant to be treatment for disease.</para>
<para id="para-00013">Dietary Guidelines are updated every five years; they help interpret and apply the RDAs to dietary patterns. In 1985, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">Dietary Guidelines</term> scientific report supporting their recommendations totaled 19 pages. In the 2020 version, the total was over 800 pages, demonstrating the prolific research occurring over the past 40 years on vitamins and minerals, dietary patterns, and health. The 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines’ call to action “Make Every Bite Count” includes four overarching values:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00007">
<item>Follow a healthy dietary pattern at every life stage.</item>
<item>Customize and enjoy nutrient-dense food and beverage choices to reflect personal preferences, cultural traditions, and budgetary considerations.</item>
<item>Focus on meeting food group needs with nutrient-dense foods and beverages and stay within calorie limits.</item>
<item>Limit foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium, and limit alcoholic beverages (U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2020).</item>

<para id="para-00017">After Curtis’s last visit to the pediatrician Auntie tries to introduce some of her favorite Haitian dishes to Curtis such as rice with a pork sauce, beef and pumpkin soup, and banana fritters. Curtis refuses to taste any of the native Haitian foods. Auntie is now watching several other children after school in addition to Curtis, and Mom continues to work rotating shifts and extra hours. Curtis spends most of the school year eating the same limited number of foods for lunch, snacks, and dinner. He rejects all attempts to include fruits and vegetables in his diet; it is cheaper, easier, and faster to adhere to Curtis’s food preferences.</para>
<para id="para-00018">Curtis is sick more often than his classmates, which causes him to miss many days of school and fall behind in his work. His mom is concerned and asks the school nurse what she should do about his inability to fight infections. The school nurse indicates Curtis’ picky eating habits were contributing to frequent illness.</para>
