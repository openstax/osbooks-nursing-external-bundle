      <para id="para-00001">Like culture, cultural competence is a dynamic process. Although there are many definitions of <term id="term-00001">cultural competence</term>, this chapter will utilize the one adopted by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN): “cultural competence encompasses the attitudes, knowledge, and skills necessary for providing quality care to diverse populations” (AACN, 2008). The process of developing cultural competence involves individuals and organizations working to understand, respect, and value a person’s or group’s unique background, identity, and characteristics. Greater cultural competence improves a nurse’s ability to understand, communicate with, and effectively provide care to individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds.</para>
    <para id="para-00003">
      Cultural competence does not mean knowing everything about every culture. With hundreds, perhaps thousands, of cultures around the world, all of them continually changing, such knowledge would be impossible. Instead, cultural competence occurs along a continuum, beginning with the first exploration of one’s own attitudes, beliefs, and values and continuing through a reflective process with the aim of providing <term id="term-00002">culturally congruent care</term>, or care that aligns with a client’s or population’s health beliefs and behaviors.
    </para>
    <para id="para-00004">
      Like cultural competence, <term id="term-00003">linguistic competence</term> also exists along a continuum, and, like cultural competence, it is not based on comprehensive knowledge. Rather, it consists of acquiring the knowledge, attitudes, and skills that enable nurses to care and advocate for clients who communicate in a language other than the one most commonly spoken and/or understood in the service setting.
    </para>
    <section id="sect-00001">
      <title>The Value of Culturally Competent Nursing</title>
      <para id="para-00005">The latest research in nursing emphasizes the importance of improving cultural competence to provide culturally congruent care (Im &amp; Chee, 2021). Cultural congruence involves recognizing and respecting cultural preferences and needs, as well as being able to provide optimal care tailored to an individual or population. Recognizing the ways that culture can influence client beliefs and behaviors, as well as the ways in which an individual’s cultural background affects their health care experiences, enables nurses to improve client outcomes, increase client satisfaction, and reduce <term id="term-00004">health inequities</term>. Studies have shown that when nurses are culturally competent, they demonstrate more empathy, communicate more effectively, and provide better client education (Umanzor &amp; Arcaute-Gonzalex, 2019). These skills improve client outcomes, increase satisfaction, and reduce health inequities, which are differences in health resources or health status based on social factors. In addition, nurses who strive to become culturally competent can more readily navigate challenging situations when providing care for diverse populations. They are more likely to be aware of the potential biases that can come into play when delivering care and better able to take steps to minimize those biases. Building relationships of trust between communities and health care professionals can help ensure that individuals receive the appropriate care they need, regardless of their cultural origins.

    <section id="sect-00002">
      <title>Culturally Congruent Care</title>
      <para id="para-00006">When nurses practice cultural competence, they aim to provide culturally congruent care. Culturally congruent care is consistent with the cultural beliefs, values, and practices of the client and tailored to their cultural needs. For example, a nurse wishes to provide culturally congruent care for a client with diabetes who has stated that they frequently consult with a traditional healer about their dietary choices. To provide culturally congruent care, the nurse takes the client’s beliefs and practices into account, perhaps consulting with a traditional practitioner to incorporate culturally appropriate foods into the client's care plan. The nurse can the client with education about their dietary choices and encourage them to continue incorporating healthy practices that are congruent with their culture.</para>

    <section id="sect-00003">
      <title>Reducing Health Inequities</title>
      <para id="para-00007">Cultural competence reduces health inequities by increasing awareness and understanding of the cultural beliefs, values, and practices of diverse populations. Cultural competence promotes respect and understanding between nurses and clients, which can bridge differences in cultural backgrounds. Nurses who respect and understand the cultural beliefs and values of a client are better prepared to provide care that is consistent with the client's cultural expectations and practices. This can help to reduce health inequities, as the client is more likely to collaborate with health care providers and to understand and follow the recommended care plan, regardless of their background or circumstances.</para>
      <para id="para-00008">Cultural competence reduces barriers and increases access to care. For example, a nurse who coordinates <term id="term-00005">translation</term> for clients who speak another language helps those clients access needed services and health-related information (Foronda &amp; Baptiste, 2022). When practicing cultural competence, nurses provide care that is tailored to the cultural needs of clients, increasing access for underserved and marginalized populations.</para>

        <title>The Educational Roots of Health Inequities</title>
        <para id="para-00009">The educational roots of health inequities result from institutional and systemic biases in policies that separate individuals into either resource-rich or resource-poor neighborhoods as these neighborhoods dictate school access. This separation into resource-rich or poor neighborhoods is principally based on socioeconomic position and race resulting in wide health disparities in life expectancy and health outcomes as education is a major factor in shaping the course of an individual’s life.</para>

      <para id="para-00011">Cultural competence also informs nurses about the <term id="term-00006">social determinants of health (SDOH)</term>, which are the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age (<link target-id="pophealth_fig_23_01_002"/>). As discussed in Social Determinants of Health, these conditions include factors such as income, education, housing, employment, and access to health care, and they can create significant health inequities (Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion [ODPHP], n.d.). For example, some communities with high levels of <term id="term-00007">poverty</term> are considered “<term id="term-00008">food deserts</term>,” areas where access to affordable and nutritious food is limited or nonexistent. This can be due to a lack of grocery stores in the area, inadequate transportation options, and low-income levels that make it difficult for residents to afford healthy food. Food deserts are a serious public health concern because they can contribute to a number of health problems, including obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. People living in food deserts are often forced to rely on convenience stores and fast-food restaurants, which tend to offer unhealthy food options that are high in calories, fat, and sodium, resulting in a higher prevalence of chronic diseases. A nurse who is aware of the impact of a food desert on the local community can advocate for the increased availability of nutritious foods in places such as corner stores, promote the incorporation of healthy foods into school meals, and provide education to help people find healthy food and make healthier choices.</para>

      <title>Improving Health Outcomes</title>
      <para id="para-00012">Culturally competent nurses better understand and respond to their clients’ needs. They recognize and respect cultural differences, remain cognizant of personal and structural biases, and provide <term id="term-00009">culturally sensitive care</term>. By understanding the unique cultural needs of their clients, nurses can provide more effective and personalized care, which can lead to improved health outcomes.</para>
      <para id="para-00013">As nurses develop their cultural competence, they attain a better understanding of the wide variety of cultures, values, beliefs, practices, and health care needs among different groups. Cultural competence supports the delivery of <term id="term-00010">culturally responsive care</term>, the process of providing care to individuals or populations that fully takes into consideration their cultural backgrounds, values, and preferences. This type of care goes beyond being sensitive to culture; it involves actively ensuring that all aspects of health care are tailored to address the needs and beliefs of a specific population (Hemmings et al., 2016). By providing care consistent with a client’s or group’s specific cultural needs and expectations, nurses foster an understanding and respectful environment, promoting trust and client collaboration. Cultural and linguistic competence also facilitates better communication between nurses and clients, improved health management, increased adherence to treatment plans, and increased client satisfaction. In turn, clients are encouraged to engage with their care, leading to improved health outcomes.</para>

    <title>Attitudes, Skills, and Knowledge</title>
    <para id="para-00016">The AACN definition of cultural competence is, above all, a call to action: It sets nurses the task of building the attitudes, skills, and knowledge necessary to provide quality care. What are those attitudes, skills, and knowledge?</para>
    <para id="para-00017">An open, non-judgmental attitude is essential to providing culturally competent care. A culturally competent nurse displays interest in learning about other beliefs and practices, a willingness to engage in dialogue that encourages learning and mutual respect, motivation to challenge assumptions and biases, a commitment to equity and inclusion, and a desire to help create a safe space for everyone. Culturally competent attitudes also include a positive approach to diversity, valuing and respecting cultural differences, and not discriminating against individuals on the basis of culture.</para>
    <para id="para-00018">An attitude critical to cultural competence is <term id="term-00012">cultural humility</term>, which entails acknowledging, respecting, and valuing cultural differences by taking responsibility for one’s own perceptions and ideas. When an individual has cultural humility, they have a deep respect for all cultures as well a desire to learn more and to understand different people’s perspectives. This approach emphasizes self-reflection, open communication, and collaboration across diverse populations. Having humility, or being humble about one’s beliefs and understanding that they are not the best or only way, also involves being aware of one’s own biases and limitations, and understanding that these can influence how one interacts with people from different cultural backgrounds.</para>
    <para id="para-00019">Among the many skills required to provide culturally competent care, a few key skills should be part of every nurse’s toolkit. Critical thinking skills are needed to identify and analyze policies, structures, and practices that are oppressive or that disadvantage certain individuals or groups. Linguistic competence is necessary so that nurses can communicate effectively with people from different backgrounds, listening empathetically and openly. The ability to adapt to new cultural environments and navigate unfamiliar situations is essential.</para>
    <para id="para-00020">As mentioned above, nurses do not need to possess knowledge of every culture they interact with. In the process of developing cultural competence, nurses seek <term id="term-00013">cultural awareness</term>. In nursing, cultural awareness is defined as “the process of understanding and respecting the beliefs, customs, languages, and values of clients from diverse cultures” (Giger &amp; Davidhizar, 2002; Giger &amp; Davidhizar, 2008). It involves recognizing that culture shapes perspectives and experiences and influences the way people express themselves, and it acknowledges that cultural norms may differ from those most often found in conventional health care settings. Cultural awareness also involves becoming knowledgeable about one's own cultural group and identifying how one's own background may influence their perspectives and behaviors, and how this may impact their interactions with people from other cultures. Cultural awareness involves the ability to recognize and appreciate individual differences and treat them with respect. It is rooted in values such as openness, respect, fairness, and mutual understanding.</para>
    <section id="sect-00006">
      <title>Valuing and Respecting Diversity</title>
      <para id="para-00021">In valuing diversity, the nurse recognizes and appreciates the unique characteristics, backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives of individuals and groups. Individuals and groups may be diverse in numerous ways, including their culture, race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, and ability. Valuing diversity involves not only recognizing that everyone is unique, and that this diversity is a valuable aspect of society, but also treating all individuals with respect and without discrimination. It involves being open to learning from, and collaborating with, people from diverse backgrounds. Valuing diversity can foster a more inclusive and welcoming environment, and it can lead to better outcomes for both individuals and organizations.</para>
      <para id="para-00022">Valuing and respecting diversity begins with acknowledging and recognizing the unique backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives of clients and colleagues. This can include learning about the wide variations found in cultural health beliefs and practices, engaging with people from different backgrounds and cultures, and treating all clients with respect and compassion. Effective communication is also critical, as is being open-minded and willing to learn from others. Nurses who advocate for diversity and inclusion in the workplace and recognize and challenge any personal biases or stereotypes that may impact their interactions with others can foster a more inclusive and nurturing environment for their clients, colleagues, communities, and organizations.</para>

      <title>Understanding Cultural Identity</title>
      <para id="para-00023"><term id="term-00014">Cultural identity</term>is the unique combination of beliefs, values, attitudes, behaviors, customs, practices, experiences, and language that make up an individual's sense of belonging to a particular group or culture. A person’s cultural identity encompasses who they are and how they fit into society, as well as their larger context within the human experience. It is an important aspect of a person's self-concept, and it can change throughout a person’s lifetime. It includes the ways in which one’s beliefs, perspectives, traditions, practices, and values are shaped by the culture, or cultures, to which they belong. Cultural identity creates belonging, connecting individuals with a community and to shared experiences and traditions with others who have a similar background. It can be influenced by external factors such as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">migration</term>, <term class="no-class" id="term-00016">globalization</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">colonization</term>.</para>

        <para id="para-00024">Read the following scenario and reflect on the questions that follow.</para>
          <para id="para-00025">Cory, a community health nurse introduced at the start of this chapter, is meeting another new client in the clinic today. Faiza is a married 28-year-old female who is trying to establish primary and obstetric care. Faiza is scheduled to meet with Nurse Cory to assist her in arranging for appropriate and timely care and to assess whether she needs other health-related resources. Informed that his client has arrived, Nurse Cory goes to the waiting room and calls Faiza’s name. A man rises from his seat, and only then does the young woman wearing a hijab head covering who was seated beside him move her head and stand. She walks behind the man to the front of the room where Nurse Cory is waiting. The man says, “She is Faiza.” Faiza does not look directly at Nurse Cory. Nurse Cory reaches his hand out to Faiza and says, “Hi, my name is Cory, and I’m the nurse you’re seeing today; nice to meet you.” Faiza does not look up and does not take Cory’s hand. She says nothing and takes a small step backward. The man, who appears to be upset, says, “She needs a woman nurse.”</para>

      <title>Identifying Personal Values and Beliefs</title>
      <para id="para-00027">An important first step in the cultural competence process is to develop an understanding of one’s own values and beliefs. This begins with an examination of one’s own life experiences, family background, cultural traditions, religious beliefs, health practices, and personal preferences. It is also important to look at how these values have changed over time, and how they influence the way a nurse interacts with others, including clients, nurse colleagues, and other health care professionals. Additionally, nurses need to examine their own biases to ensure that they are not perpetuating any stereotypes or prejudices when providing care. This process will be covered in more detail in the next section.</para>
