<para id="para-00002"><term id="term-00001">Loop diuretics</term> are the most frequently prescribed type of diuretic drug. They are used to treat fluid volume excess and edema associated with heart failure, hypertension, cirrhosis, and renal disease. Loop diuretics act at different points in the nephron to increase sodium and water losses.</para>
<section id="sect-00002">
<title>Introduction and Use</title>
<para id="para-00003">Loop diuretics increase urinary output by blocking the reabsorption of sodium in the (thick) ascending loop of Henle. The drugs work by inhibiting the action of the <term id="term-00002">sodium–potassium–chloride (Na-K-2Cl or NKCC2) cotransporters</term> in the luminal membrane and increasing water excretion. Blocking the NKCC2 cotransporter blocks potassium reabsorption and triggers calcium and magnesium losses. Loop diuretics are commonly recommended for treating edematous conditions and fluid volume excess associated with heart failure and renal disease. They are approved for treating hypertension but are usually prescribed in combination with other antihypertensives (Huxel et al., 2022). The most frequently used loop diuretics, furosemide, torsemide, and bumetanide, are recommended for treating specific conditions according to their half-life and bioavailability characteristics.</para>
<para id="para-00004">Furosemide, a frequently prescribed loop diuretic, treats edematous conditions and fluid volume excess in heart failure, liver failure, and acute and chronic renal disease, including nephrotic syndrome (Khan et al., 2023). It can be given orally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intravenously. The bioavailability of oral doses of furosemide is approximately 50%, and the drug has a shorter half-life (1.5–2 hours) than other loop diuretics, which means that a continuous intravenous infusion may be more effective than intermittent doses in critically ill clients (Khan et al., 2023). Furoscix was approved in 2022 for subcutaneous delivery of a daily metered dose of furosemide by an on-body infuser for outpatient clients with New York Heart Association class II or III chronic heart failure (Dahiya et al., 2022).This delivery system is intended for clients in the home setting for whom oral furosemide administration has limited effectiveness.</para>
<para id="para-00005">Torsemide exhibits a stronger diuretic effect than furosemide does (Yifan et al., 2021). The drug is used to treat heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, and chronic renal disease, and it is used with other antihypertensive drugs to treat hypertension (Kanderi &amp; Vaitla, 2022). It can be administered orally or intravenously. The bioavailability of torsemide given by mouth or intravenously is 80%, and the duration of action is 6–8 hours (Kanderi &amp; Vaitla, 2022).</para>
<para id="para-00006">Bumetanide is used to treat clients who do not respond to other loop diuretics, have severe renal disease, or require larger diuretic doses (Sidhu &amp; Puckett, 2023). It is used to manage heart failure, hypertension, hypercalcemia, oliguria, and <term id="term-00003">ascites</term> associated with liver failure, and it may also replace furosemide in clients with additional risk factors for <term id="term-00004">ototoxicity</term>. The drug can be administered orally, intramuscularly, or intravenously.</para>

<title>Adverse Effects and Contraindications</title>
<para id="para-00008">Loop diuretics primarily cause diuresis-induced electrolyte imbalances (Huxel et al., 2022). These alterations are more common in older adults and clients with inadequate fluid intake. Other common adverse effects include headache, dizziness, and postural hypotension. Metabolic effects may include hyperlipidemia, metabolic alkalosis, and hyperglycemia due to impaired glucose tolerance. Drug-induced pancreatitis also has been reported, most often in clients with a history of pancreatitis. Less common reactions include impotence, thrombocytopenia due to the secretion of antibodies, thrombotic events related to <term id="term-00008">hypovolemia</term>, and ototoxicity due to rapid intravenous administration.</para>
<para id="para-00009">Loop diuretics should be used with care in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">older adults</term> and clients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other risk factors for fluid volume and electrolyte alterations, such as dehydration and increased glucose tolerance. Clients who are allergic to sulfa may possibly experience a mild reaction when using loop diuretics.</para>
<para id="para-00010">Severe dehydration or anuria is a contraindication to any diuretic (Arumugham &amp; Shahin, 2023). Loop diuretics are contraindicated in clients with sensitivity to one of the individual drugs (furosemide, torsemide, or bumetanide) and in clients with Stevens–Johnson syndrome due to the probability of a sensitivity reaction.</para>

<title>Use of Diuretics in Older Adults</title>
<para id="para-00012">Research indicates that <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">older adults</term> have an increased risk of falling associated with diuretic use. Various adverse effects associated with diuretic use contribute to fall risk, including orthostatic hypotension, increased urine output causing more frequent trips to the bathroom, increased risk of fluid and electrolyte disorders leading to cognitive changes, and effects on bone mass and muscle strength.</para>
