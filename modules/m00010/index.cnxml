    <para id="para-00001">Digestion occurs as an integrated process between the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract and accessory systems in the body. Proper digestive processes are needed to ensure nutrients are supplied to the body and homeostasis through fluid and electrolyte balance, adequate nutritional status, proper growth patterns, and body repair needs are maintained. Common end products of digestion are amino acids, simple carbohydrates, lipids, vitamins, and minerals. </para>
    <para id="para-00003">The digestive system is responsible for digestion in the body. The main organs of digestion, the gastrointestinal system, begin at the mouth and end at the anus. This system is divided into the upper gastrointestinal system, which starts at the mouth and ends at the duodenum (the very start of the small intestines), and the lower gastrointestinal system, which starts with the small intestines and includes the large intestines (or colon), rectum, and anus. Other organs in the digestive system that are not along the main gastrointestinal system tract that aid in digestion but do not come in direct contact with food, the accessory organs, include the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder (<link target-id="nutrition_fig_04_01_002"/>).</para>

    <para id="para-00004">It is the purpose of this system and the accessory systems and organs that work with it to receive food, release nutrients and water from the food through digestive processes, deliver these nutrients into the blood and absorb the water that passes through the colon for body use, and to finally excrete nondigestible solid waste from the body (U. S. National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, n.d.).</para>

    <section id="sect-00001">
      <title>Organs of the Upper Gastrointestinal System</title>
      <para id="para-00005">The upper gastrointestinal system is comprised of the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. Food enters the gastrointestinal tract through the mouth, and the mouth has several components that are important to normal digestive processes. The teeth, tongue, and salivary glands facilitate the breakdown of food through mechanical (chewing) and chemical (enzymes) means as accessory organs in the digestive system. Without any one of these components, the mouth would not be able to fully function as it is designed to in the digestive process.</para>
      <para id="para-00006">Food then travels from the mouth, through the upper esophageal sphincter, down the esophagus, through the lower esophageal sphincter, into the stomach, out of the stomach through the pyloric sphincter, and into the duodenum (<link target-id="nutrition_fig_04_01_003"/>). The process of digestion through the upper gastrointestinal tract, which ends in gastric emptying, can take from two to five hours to complete (Readman, 2022).</para>

      <title>Organs of the Lower Gastrointestinal System</title>
      <para id="para-00007">The lower gastrointestinal system is comprised of the small intestines, large intestines, rectum, and anus Food exits the body as waste through the anus in the lower gastrointestinal system. Food enters this portion of the gastrointestinal system tract through the duodenum after gastric emptying occurs. By this time, food is no longer in its solid state. It has been converted to a substance known as <term id="term-00001">chyme</term>, a mix of gastric juices and digested food. After digestive processes are complete in the duodenum, the chyme moves into and through the small intestines, through the large intestines, down to the rectum, and out of the body through the anus. The process of digestion through the lower gastrointestinal tract can take from 10 to 59 hours (Readman, 2022).

      <title>Accessory Organs and Systems Impacting Digestion</title>
      <para id="para-00008">Organs that lie outside of the main gastrointestinal tract but are still considered part of the digestion system as they directly aid in digestion through release of enzymes and digestive fluids include the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder (GI Associates and Endoscopy Center, 2022). Other organs, body structures, and systems within the body that directly or indirectly aid in digestion in the body but are not considered a part of the digestion system include teeth, saliva glands, the tongue, the sensory system, the nervous system, mucous membranes, and glands (University of Rochester Medical Center, 2022). These organs and structures are not considered a part of the digestion system because they are either part of another organ or body structure, part of another main body system, or their function towards digestion only serves another body function and is not a primary function. Without them, however, the digestive process would malfunction and not be able to be adequately performed by the main gastrointestinal system in all areas of its expected function.</para>
      <para id="para-00009">The accessory organs’ main function is assisting in the chemical digestive process. The pancreas, liver, and gallbladder have this as a primary function related to the digestive system. The <term id="term-00002" class="no-emphasis">pancreas</term>, while it performs other functions for the body, produces amylase, lipase, trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, elastase, carboxypeptidase, nucleases, and protease that help to chemically digest sugars, fats, and starches (GI Associates and Endoscopy Center, 2022; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 2022; U. S. National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, n.d.). The pancreas is also responsible for the production of <term id="term-00003">insulin</term>, which is responsible for assisting in the absorption process of glucose into cells. The liver creates and secretes <term id="term-00004">bile</term> to aid in the chemical breakdown of fats into amino acids. The gallbladder stores and concentrates bile for release into the duodenum. The bile’s release into the duodenum is triggered by the cells in the duodenum with the release of the hormone <term id="term-00005" class="no-emphasis">cholecystokinin</term> (Holman et al., 2019; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 2022; (U. S. National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, n.d.).</para>
      <para id="para-00010">
        The other systems impacting the digestive processes do so through triggering of production for enzymes, release of enzymes, or triggering of certain other body processes that allow for both chemical and mechanical processes for digestion, absorption, or metabolism based on the body’s specific needs. The nervous system in the gastrointestinal tract is a mesh-like system of neurons that coordinates the whole process of secretion and digestion in the intestines and is responsible for peristalsis (Holman et al., 2019). The sensory system aids in the desire to ingest as well as the release of saliva as the sight, smell, and taste of food will trigger saliva to be released. Glands and mucosal membranes of the intestinal walls secrete small amounts of digestive enzymes and lubricating mucous to assist with waste movement and absorb nutrients from the food as it is traveling through (Holman et al., 2019; U. S. National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, n.d.).

      <title>Congenital Anomalies within Digestive Organs</title>
      <para id="para-00011">While rare, there are many congenital anomalies, or birth defects, that can affect the digestive system’s ability to complete its required functions. The majority of them cause blockages in the exit of waste products and result from undeveloped or incorrectly positioned organs (Columbia University Irving Medical Center, n.d.). These abnormalities can generally be classified as atresia, stenosis, and malformations, malrotation and volvulus, Meckel’s diverticulum, lymphangiectasia, Hirschsprung’s disease, and other (Columbia University Irving Medical Center, n.d.; Ludwig et al., 2022), which are detailed in . Some of these abnormalities are severe enough to be detected in-utero or even very soon after birth, while some remain undetected through childhood until they cause physical symptoms (Ludwig et al., 2022).</para>

        <title>Atresia, Stenosis, and Malformation</title>
        <para id="para-00012">Atresia is a complete blockage in the system, and stenosis is a partial blockage due to a hardening and narrowing of an area. Malformations are an abnormal formation of a specific body part. This type of congenital anomaly has several different types, including anorectal, biliary, esophageal, gastric, and intestinal.

  <para id="para-00024">Abdominal wall defects are another type of congenital anomaly in which the digestive organs (usually stomach or intestines) protrude through the abdominal wall (Riley Children’s Health, 2022). There are two main types of abdominal wall defects: the omphalocele, which is when these organs protrude from the abdominal wall near the umbilicus into a thin protective membranous sac, and the gastroschisis, which is caused when the abdominal wall does not close completely during development and the intestines protrude unprotected outside of the abdomen through an opening near the umbilicus. The omphalocele is often accompanied by genetic syndromes, while there is not generally any genetic syndromes associated with a gastroschisis. Some genetic syndromes associated with the omphalocele include Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Donnai-Barrow syndrome, Shprintzen-Goldberg omphalocele syndrome, Melnick-Needles syndrome, Carpenter syndrome, Pentalogy of Cantrell, OEIS complex, and Trisomy 13, 18, and 21 (UpToDate, 2022). Symptoms for these anomalies include abdominal organs visibly protruding through the skin of the abdomen with or without thin membranous covering, bulging or bubbled appearance around the umbilical cord, and digestive problems due to poor circulation and irritation of the digestive organs (Riley Children’s Health, 2022). Often, this congenital anomaly can be seen on ultrasound before birth (<link target-id="nutrition_fig_04_01_004"/>).<footnote id="foot-00003">It would be the rare occasion that a footnote related to body text might be needed, but we want to account for them just in case.</footnote>

  <para id="para-00025">Duplication cysts, also known as enteric cysts, occur when an additional and unnecessary portion of the intestines forms and attaches somewhere along the digestive tract. While this may occur anywhere from the mouth to the rectum, it occurs most commonly in the ileum, then esophagus, colon, jejunum, or stomach, and then duodenum (Columbia University Irving Medical Center, n.d.; Nebot et al., 2018). These are usually detected in-utero via ultrasound or by two years of age (Nebot et al., 2018). Symptoms of these abnormalities depends heavily on their location and can range greatly to include respiratory distress, dysphagia, retrosternal pain, hemoptysis, nausea, vomiting, abdominal distention, palpable abdominal mass, recurrent abdominal pain, intussusception, obstruction due to extrinsic bowel compression, and inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, or perforation of the gastric mucosa.</para>

Since his cardiologist would like him to lose about 20lb to get his BMI at a healthy weight, and Jim thinks mild weight loss of 0.5lb/week is attainable, Jim needs 1,895 calories per day.
