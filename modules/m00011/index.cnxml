  <content><para id="para-00001">Assessment of the gastrointestinal system is imperative in both prevention and health maintenance in many diseases and in regard to promotion and maintenance of nutrition. The body relies totally on this system to break down food intake into usable nutrition so proper assessment of this system is extremely important to nutritional health. Identifying and, if possible, rectifying any issues found in the normal function and anatomy of this system will aid the client in staying at optimal nutritional health. While physical assessment of the client is required, the nurse should also obtain a history of the client’s dietary practices, normal eating and bowel patterns, any dietary intolerances or allergies, any changes in normal eating and bowel patterns, recent unintentional weight loss or gain, and any medical diagnoses or surgical history. The nurse will also need to obtain the client’s weight and height so that an accurate body mass index (BMI) can be calculated.</para>

  <title>Mouth and Oropharynx Assessment</title>
  <para id="para-00003">
    Assessment of the mouth and oropharynx is an assessment of the majority of the upper gastrointestinal system. The nurse will inspect the mouth and oropharynx, beginning with the outer lips to judge for symmetry, color, texture, and contouring. The client should be asked to purse their lips as if to form a whistle to judge for movement ability and symmetry. Next, the inner lips and buccal mucosa should be inspected for color, texture, moisture, and presence of lesions or other abnormal structures. To best visualize these structures, the nurse should direct the client to relax the mouth. Then the nurse should pull the bottom lip outward and away from the client’s teeth by grasping the lip between the thumb and index finger on each side of the lip and carefully pulling outward (Pearson Education, 2018).
  </para>
  <para id="para-00004">
    There are expected normal findings for each portion of this assessment. The lips are expected to be symmetrical and uniform in color (and appropriate coloration for race), soft, moist, smooth textured, symmetrically contoured, and able to be pursed easily and symmetrically (Pearson Education, 2018). Drooling may be seen in young infants and toddlers up to age two, but should not be excessive. Deviations from these findings are abnormal and should be reported. Abnormal findings that should be reported immediately include cyanosis, which can indicate low oxygen levels, and sudden and new unilateral asymmetry with movement as this could indicate a cerebrovascular accident.
  </para>
  <para id="para-00005">
    Deviations from these normal findings that could be indicative of nutritional deficiencies or fluid deficits include fissures, crusts, or scales on the lips or in the corners of the lips. Specifically, Vitamin B1, Thiamine, Vitamin B12, and iron, can all be visibly detected in a client’s outer oral assessment by the presence of cracked lips or <term id="term-00001">angular cheilitis</term> (Hakes, 2021).
  </para>
<para id="para-00006">
  Inspection of the teeth and gums should be done while inspecting the buccal mucosa. To accomplish this, the nurse should:
<list list-type="enumerated" id="list-00002">
  <item>Direct the client to open their mouth.</item>
  <item>Use a tongue blade/depressor to retract each cheek while using a flashlight or penlight to properly visualize the surfaces. When evaluating the teeth at the back of the mouth on either side, the nurse should direct the client to close their mouth.</item>
  <item>Place the index fingers of both hands into one side of the mouth, ask the client to open their mouth, and retract each cheek using the index fingers.</item>
  <item>Direct the client to slowly open and close their mouth while the cheek is retracted so that tooth alignment can be visualized.</item>
  <item>Inspect the gums should be inspected in this same manner.</item>
</list>
If the client has dentures, bridges, or other removable dental appliances, have them remove them and repeat this evaluation for the gums separately. Check gums for retraction, color, bleeding, edema, or lesions (Pearson Education, 2018).
</para>
<para id="para-00007">
  The buccal mucosa and inner lips are expected to be uniform color that is appropriate for race (or freckled brown in darker-skinned individuals), moist (may be slightly drier in older clients due to decreased salivation), glistening, smooth, and elastic texture (Pearson Education, 2018). Gums should be moist and firm without retraction away from the teeth, however, in older clients, there may be some receding of the gum line and some hyperpigmentation (Holman et al., 2021; Pearson Education, 2018). The tongue should rest in the central position in the mouth but move freely, have no tenderness or swelling, be smooth with lateral margins and raised papillae (taste buds), and free of lesions (Pearson Education, 2018). The base of the tongue should be smooth and prominent with veins and absent of ulceration. The gag reflex should be present. All deviations from these findings are abnormal and should be reported. Abnormal findings that should be reported immediately include cyanosis as this could indicate low oxygen levels, and any suspicious lesions, as these could indicate oral cancers, and any plaques, as these can indicate infection.
</para>
<para id="para-00008">
  There are multiple deviations in these areas of the assessment that can indicate nutritional deficiency. Inflammation of the tongue and ulcerative gingivitis could be indicative of Vitamin B<sub>2</sub> (Riboflavin) and Vitamin B<sub>2</sub> deficiencies. Loss of taste can be the result of a Zinc deficiency (Stewart, 2022). Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency is indicated in some clients by halitosis, hemorrhagic gingivitis, and painful mouth ulcers. Vitamin C deficiency is also a culprit that causes bleeding gingivitis (Hakes, 2021). Stomatitis, mouth inflammation, can be the result of Vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, B<sub>2</sub> (Riboflavin), and B<sub>12</sub> deficiencies (American Dental Association, 2022; Hakes, 2021). Iron deficiency can be indicated by dryness from salivary gland dysfunction and dysphagia and a red, painful tongue that has a burning sensation (Hakes, 2021). Zinc deficiency has been linked to recurrent aphthous ulcers, known as canker sores, in the mouth (American Dental Association, 2022).
</para>

  <title>Contraindications for Use of a Tongue Blade/Depressor</title>
  <para id="para-00009">When examining the oral cavity, if epiglottitis is suspected, avoid examination with a tongue blade/depressor and do not place anything in the client’s mouth as this can trigger laryngospasm and close off the patency of the client’s airway, causing a life-threatening emergency (Guerra &amp; Waseem, 2022). Symptoms of epiglottitis to be alert for include hyperthermia, sore throat, stridor, dysphagia, and drooling (Mayo Clinic, 2022a). Children may also act anxious and irritable and sit up or lean forward to ease breathing while adults may also have a muffled or hoarse voice and difficulty breathing.</para>
</note>
<para id="para-00010">
  Next, inspect the tongue and the floor of the mouth. Have the client open their mouth and stick their tongue out to inspect it for position, color, texture, and moisture. Have the client curl their tongue upward and move it side to side to assess mobility of the tongue. Lastly, have the client stick the tip of their tongue to the roof of their mouth and inspect the base of the tongue, the mouth floor, and the <term id="term-00002">frenulum</term> for color, texture, bleeding, moisture, and lesions (Pearson Education, 2018).
</para>
<para id="para-00011">
  The hard and soft palates should be colored appropriately for race. The soft palate will be smooth where the hard palate will be more irregularly textured. In newborns, it is normal to find <term id="term-00003">Epstein cysts</term>, <term id="term-00004">Bohn nodules</term>, or gingival cysts in the mouth on the mucosa, gums, and/or palate and they appear as small, painless, white-yellow, firm, papules that are one to three millimeters in diameter and they do not require treatment or cause difficulties as they resolve on their own (Diaz de Ortiz &amp; Mendez, 2022). The uvula should be midline at the back of the soft palate and freely movable. The oropharynx is expected to appear smooth and pink at the posterior wall. The tonsils are expected to be colored appropriately for race and smooth and of normal size or not visible and without discharge (Pearson Education, 2018). Tonsils are generally larger in children than adults. Tonsil size and visibility should be documented: +1 as barely visible, +2 as halfway to the uvula, +3 as touching the uvula, and +4 as touching each other or midline (Holman et al., 2021). Findings outside of these are considered abnormal. Abnormal findings that should be reported immediately include cyanosis as this could indicate low oxygen levels; any suspicious lesions, as these could indicate cancer; uvula that is not midline or freely movable, as this could indicate tumor, trauma, or nerve damage; uvula in a newborn that is forked or bifurcated, as this could indicate undetected cleft palate; any plaques or drainage in oropharynx, as this could indicate acute infection; and swelling or drainage of tonsils as this could indicate acute infection (Pearson Education, 2018).
</para>
<para id="para-00012">
  Deviations in normal findings in the oropharynx, tonsils, and palates and uvula can indicate certain nutritional deficiencies. Recurrent tonsillitis is linked to Vitamin D deficiency (Mirza et al, 2020). Pharyngitis, or sore throat, can be the result of Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin) deficiency (Johnson, 2022). Zinc deficiency can result in a canker sore developing on the uvula (American Dental Association, 2022). Stomatitis can be the result of Vitamin B6, B2 (Riboflavin), and B12 deficiencies, which will also affect the palates of the mouth (<link target-id="table-00001"/>).

  <title>Abdominal Assessment</title>
  <para id="para-00013">
    Assessment of the abdomen is an assessment of the rest of the upper gastrointestinal system (stomach and duodenum), the accessory organs of the digestive system (pancreas, liver, and gallbladder), and the majority of the lower gastrointestinal system (large and small intestines). Assessment of the abdomen must occur in a specific order: inspection, auscultation, percussion, and then palpation. Auscultating before percussing and palpating ensures the assessor is listening to undisturbed bowel sounds and leaving palpation for last ensures that the potentially most painful portion of the assessment is completed last so that most of the data is collected before discomfort is caused to the client (Hakes, 2021).

    <title>Positioning the Client for Abdominal Assessment</title>
    <para id="para-00014">When preparing the client for abdominal assessment, it is important to position them so that their abdominal wall musculature is relaxed. To achieve this, have the client lie supine and support the head and behind the knees with pillows.</para>
  </note>
<section id="sect-00003">
  <title>Inspection</title>
  <para id="para-00015">Inspection should be the first step in the assessment of the abdomen. This should be done with the client on a completely supine position with the abdomen exposed (Roscoe, 2022). Inspect the skin integrity, abdomen contour, symmetry, and vascular patterns (Pearson Education, 2018). Visualize abdominal movement associated with respirations, aortic blood flow, and <term id="term-00005">peristalsis</term>.</para>
</section>
<section id="sect-00004">
  <title>Auscultation</title>
  <para id="para-00016">Auscultation of the abdomen is the next step in the assessment. When auscultating the abdomen, listen for bowel sounds, peritoneal friction rubs, and vascular sounds with a stethoscope. Bowel sounds should be listened for in each of the four quadrants of the abdomen with the diaphragm of the stethoscope calculating the rate after listening for at least two minutes in each quadrant and no longer than five minutes (Mealie et al., 2022; Pearson Education, 2018). The diaphragm of the stethoscope should also be used to listen for the absence of peritoneal friction rubs over the spleen and liver as the client breathes in deeply. The bell of the stethoscope should be used when evaluating for vascular sounds. The bell should be used to listen over the aorta, renal arteries, femoral arteries, and iliac arteries in the abdomen to listen for the absence of bruits (Pearson Education, 2018). If there is suspected delay in gastric emptying, place the stethoscope on the abdomen near the stomach, hold the client’s hips and gently shake them from side to side while listening to their abdomen for a <term id="term-00006">succession splash</term> (Mealie et al., 2022). This may be uncomfortable to the client, so the nurse should inform the client on what to expect.</para>

    <para id="para-00017">African Americans and clients of African descent with hypertension demonstrate a lower response to ACE inhibitor monotherapy. ACE inhibitors interfere with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which causes high blood pressure when renin levels are high. Clients of African Americans and African descent often have hypertension, but also have lower levels of renin. Therefore, concomitant therapy may be required to increase response to antihypertensive therapies. Source: https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2012/019777s060lbl.pdf</para>

  <title>Percussion</title>
  <para id="para-00018">
    Percussion of the abdomen should be done next to determine the presence of gas, fluid, or masses. Using a systematic pattern beginning in the lower right quadrant proceeding in a pattern towards the upper right quadrant, upper left quadrant, and then lower left quadrant, percuss several areas of each quadrant to listen to the quality of the sound; tympany relates to gas, or flatus, and dullness, decrease, absence, or flatness in sound relates to fluid or solid masses. Percussion is also used to best judge size of the spleen and liver (Mealie et al., 2022). To percuss for splenic size, the most inferior interspace on the left anterior axillary line, or the Castell’s point, should be percussed at the client breathes in deeply to listen for the start of dullness from tympany to discover the splenic edge. On the right side, percuss down from the lung and up from the bowel to discover the change from tympany to dullness to locate the liver margins.
  </para>
</section>
<section id="sect-00006">
  <title>Palpation</title>
  <para id="para-00019">
    The last step in the abdominal assessment is palpation. There are three stages to palpations: superficial or light palpation, deep palpation, and organ palpation that should be done in the order listed (Mealie et al., 2022). For superficial palpation, the palm should be held slightly above the abdomen with the fingers parallel and then the abdominal wall is depressed lightly at only about one centimeter with the finger pads, which is about the level of the subcutaneous tissue (Pearson Education, 2018). The finger pads should be moved around in a circular motion over all the quadrants while noting any areas of tenderness, masses, crepitus, irregularity in contour, or muscle guarding. If a known area of pain is already present on the abdomen, start farthest from the area of pain with any form of palpation and end in that area last (Table 4.3).

    After light palpation is complete, move on to deep palpation. This is done slowly with the same hand position and in the same manner, except the depth of pressing is increased with firmer and more steady pressure to explore deeper while still noting tenderness, masses, and muscle guarding (Mealie et al., 2022). While palpating deeply in the periumbilical, inguinal, and suprapubic regions, have the client cough while feeling for a mass to ensure there is no hidden hernia.

    The final step is palpation of the organs. This is done over specific organs in the abdomen to feel for margins to assess for inflammation and enlargement. We will discuss only the assessment of the gastrointestinal organs in the abdomen in this section as there are other organs assessed in this assessment (Mealie et al., 2022). Palpation of the liver is done by placing the hand below the right lower rib margin by having the client exhale then inhale deeply while feeling for the margins and any nodularity. The gallbladder is then palpated in the same area by placing the palpating hand under the lower right rib margin at the midclavicular line. Ask the client to exhale deeply, then push in deeper slowly and ask the client to inhale while watching for a sudden cessation of inhalation due to pain known as Murphy’s sign. The spleen is palpated by placing the hand in the right lower quadrant and moving it toward the splenic flexure until the hand reaches the left lower rib margin at which time the client should be asked to exhale and then inhale deeply.

    There are expected normal findings in each portion of this assessment. On inspection, the skin is expected to be intact, uniform in color, absent of ecchymosis, coloring consistent with race, absent of jaundice, and silver-white striae (stretch marks) and not purple-pink striae unless actively pregnant, or surgical scars if applicable to that client (Pearson Education, 2018). The abdomen should be flat, rounded, or scaphoid (sunken appearance), but not distended, and there should be no evidence of spleen or liver enlargement or protrusions (Mealie et al., 2022; Pearson Education, 2018). There should be no visible vascular patterns, respirations should cause symmetrical movements of the abdomen, and in very lean people, aortic pulsations at the epigastric area and visible peristalsis may be present (Pearson Education, 2018). In newborns and very young infants, up to around four weeks old, it is an expected finding to visualize the umbilical stump still attached (Gantan &amp; Wiedrich, 2022).

  <para id="para-00024">
    Normal findings during auscultation include findings related to bowel sounds, peritoneal friction, and vascular sounds. For vascular sounds, it is expected that there is an absence of bruit over each vascular area assessed (Pearson Education, 2018). There should also be an absence of friction rub in the peritoneum at all locations. Normal active bowel sounds should be low-pitched and gurgling and occur every five to twenty seconds lasting from less than one second to several seconds for each sound (Mealie et al., 2022; Pearson Education, 2018). There should also be no succession splash heard if the maneuver is heard.

  <title>Deviations</title>
  <para id="para-00027">Deviations from these normal findings can indicate health problems within the lower gastrointestinal tract and accessory organs that can impact the body’s ability to break down and absorb nutrition and eliminate wastes. On inspection many things can be found as a deviation from expected findings. Abdominal distention can indicate a very wide range of problems like small bowel obstruction, abdominal aortic aneurysm, masses, tumors, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, hernia, cancer, and constipation (Mealie et al., 2022). Visible patches of ecchymosis on the abdomen can indicate several forms of hemorrhage in the abdomen. Grey Turner sign which is ecchymosis of the flank and groin is seen in pancreatic hemorrhages while Cullen’s sign which is periumbilical ecchymosis is seen in retroperitoneal and intra-abdominal hemorrhages. Purple-pink striae in the absence of late pregnancy can indicate Cushing’s syndrome; vein dilation seen as a visible vascular pattern can indicate portal hypertension or vena cava obstruction; and <term id="term-00007">Caput Medusae</term>, abdominal distention, and jaundice can indicate cirrhosis and/or other liver failure. Any open skin in the form of a fistula or sinus can indicate a deeper infection. Very marked aortic pulsations, even in very lean clients, can be indicative of aortic aneurysm (Pearson Education, 2018). For newborns and young infants with umbilical cord stumps still in place, umbilical hernias may be seen as weakened appearing fascia below the umbilicus (Gantan &amp; Wiedrich, 2022). Other deviations in the umbilical stump appearance can include surrounding erythema, induration and tenderness (on palpation), all of which can indicate <term id="term-00008">]omphalitis</term> and should be reported immediately. All deviations from expected findings should be reported; however, signs of hemorrhage and severe distention should be reported immediately (see <link target-id="table_04_02_05"/> for easy reference).</para>

  <para id="para-00028">During auscultation deviations can be found in any of the three main sounds. With vascular sounds, the presence of a bruit in any site is abnormal and could indicate possible aneurysm (Pearson Education, 2018). When listening for peritoneal friction rubs, if any are heard in any auscultated area of the abdomen, this is an abnormal finding and could be indicative of peritoneal inflammation. Bowel sounds that deviate from the normal findings can have different indications depending on what deviation is discovered. Bowel sounds that are absent even after five minutes of listening could indicate ileus (Mealie et al., 2022). Hyperactive rushes in bowel sounds or borborygmi, can indicate small bowel obstruction or diarrhea. If delayed gastric emptying was suspected and the maneuver performed, auscultation of a succession splash is abnormal and is indicative of delayed gastric emptying being present. All deviations should be reported; however, any symptoms of aneurysm, ileus, obstruction, or peritoneal inflammation should be reported immediately.</para>
  <para id="para-00029">During percussion, if there is an unexpected sound in an area or large areas of the same sound, this is considered abnormal. Large areas of dullness can be associated with tumors or fluid collections like ascites (Pearson Education, 2018). Organs like the stomach that is air-filled is expected to sound tympanic; if it is dull or flat, this is abnormal (Mealie et al., 2022). All deviations should be reported immediately as these all can be very serious.</para>
