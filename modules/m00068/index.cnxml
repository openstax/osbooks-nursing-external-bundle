  <title>Planning Nutrition Goals</title>
  <para id="para-00002">The nurse should consider a client’s current renal system when planning nutritional goals; therefore, plans will vary accordingly. For the client with healthy kidneys, the goals of nutrition should focus more on dietary needs for comorbidities, including limiting sodium, trans fats, saturated fats, and alcohol; eating appropriate amounts of protein; and maintaining adequate fluid balance.</para>
  <para id="para-00003">When creating nutritional plans for clients with compromised kidneys, the nurse should collaborate with a renal dietician and consider all laboratory test values. The plans for these clients should focus on limiting fluid intake, potassium, phosphorus, sodium, trans fat, saturated fats, magnesium, and proteins, while increasing calcium. Note that at the start of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">dialysis</term>, slightly different restrictions apply.</para>
  <section id="sect-00003">
  <title>The Healthy Renal System Goals</title>
  <para id="para-00004">The nurse should direct clients with a healthy renal system and no comorbidities to consider nutritional goals for renal wellness. A good starting point is to use the MyPlate portioning method with every meal (de Bellefonds, 2021). In addition, it is important to limit sodium intake to no more than 2,300 mg daily. Because the majority of sodium intake comes from processed foods and not table salt, encourage clients to avoid pre-processed foods or, at minimum, choose no-sodium or low-sodium options.</para>
  <note class="media-feature" id="note-00001">
  <title>MyPlate</title>
  <para id="para-00005"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002"><link url="https://openstax.org/r/myplateg">MyPlate</link></term> pictorially represents healthy portion sizes of different food groups in a nutritionally sound diet. This tool is useful as a good starting point for any healthy client trying to improve their nutritional intake to maintain health.</para>
  </note>
  <para id="para-00006">Clients should also be aware of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">protein intake</term> because protein byproducts are filtered through the kidneys. Clients should eat enough protein to maintain overall health, but not consume too much because the kidneys will have to work extra hard.</para>
  <para id="para-00007">The nurse should encourage the client to choose complex carbohydrates such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lentils, and beans over simple carbohydrates such as sweetened beverages, packaged foods, and desserts (de Bellefonds, 2021). Heart health is important to kidney health, so limiting saturated fats and avoiding artificial trans fat is recommended. The client should consider limiting, or even eliminating, their alcohol intake. Alcohol is a waste product that the kidneys need to filter out, making it less efficient to filter out other things during this time; alcohol is also dehydrating, which affects the kidneys’ ability to regulate the body’s hydration status.</para>
  <para id="para-00008">Another factor the nurse should consider is any <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">comorbidities</term> a client has. For example, a client who has a healthy renal system but has hypertension or diabetes is at much higher risk for developing CKD. Dietary goals should include foods that will keep these pathologies under control, as well as include nutrients that support renal health once a client has developed CKD.</para>
  <note class="special-considerations" id="note-00002">
  <title>Fads for Weight Loss—Dangers to Renal System Health</title>
  <para id="para-00009">Diets that promote excessive or reduced intake of specific nutrients, such as protein or carbohydrates, can be dangerous because they limit many nutrients and promote disease. For example, diets with excess red meats and saturated fats may cause heart disease; diets high in protein can lead to intraglomerular hypertension that may cause renal hyperfiltration, glomerular injury, and proteinuria, which could lead to CKD (Gang-Jee, et al., 2020). Well-known diets that require extreme nutritional changes include Atkins, Keto, Dukan, Montignac, Scarsdale, Stillman, and the Zone.</para>

  <title>Identifying Challenges to Nutritional Goals</title>
  <para id="para-00011">Many barriers exist for clients with CKD—the more advanced the disease, the higher the likelihood that a client will, either deliberately or accidentally, not follow a nutritional plan. The nutritional plan for clients with CKD restricts fluids, fat, sodium, phosphorus, protein, magnesium, and potassium and increases calcium, which presents many challenges, especially before transplantation. The nurse should counsel the client on the following:</para>
  <list id="list-00002">
  <item>Restricting fluids can be extremely difficult; the kidneys will excrete more urine if unable to concentrate solutes in smaller urine amounts. The client will then become extremely thirsty because they are losing much more water than they are permitted to drink each day.</item>
  <item>Sodium and phosphorus are not only found in certain fresh items but are also added to many processed foods as preservatives. Processed foods are much cheaper and more readily available to clients with busy lives, so it is more difficult to avoid these types of foods. Fast foods—prepared foods that are readily available—are not only extremely high in both sodium and phosphorus, but also in fat content. The nurse should counsel the client to limit their fast-food intake to only once or twice a week</item>
  <item>The client with CKD also needs to understand how to combine plant protein sources in the right amounts and types to replace proteins easily found in meat. Although lean meat protein sources are acceptable, options tend to be more expensive.</item>
  <item>The challenge faced when limiting magnesium is that many food sources high in magnesium are high in plant proteins, which can replace meat proteins, making selections more limited. Another difficult balance to achieve with magnesium is that many high calcium foods that need to be increased are also high in magnesium.</item>
  <item>Lastly, potassium is found naturally in a variety of fresh and healthy food choices. Many foods that the client was taught to eat before they had CKD to manage hypertension, diabetes, or any number of other comorbidities, will be ones they now have to avoid due to high potassium content. Potassium is the opposite of most other foods on the list—it is high in fresh food options and low in processed food options.</item>
