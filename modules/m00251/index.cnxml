    <title>Handling of Chemotherapeutic Agents</title>
    <para id="para-00002">The complexity of administering <term id="term-00001">chemotherapy</term> and caring for clients that have been treated with cancer therapies requires advanced knowledge. Special training and certifications to administer chemotherapy are required. Chemotherapy agents may cause cytotoxic exposure to those who compound and administer these drugs as well as to clients, families, and other caretakers who might be exposed through spills, improper handling and disposal, and other means. Proper training in compounding, administering, and managing exposure emergencies is a requirement of all personnel who work with chemotherapy. Principles of appropriate handling include, but are not limited to, storage of cytotoxic substances in impervious containers, double gloving (chemotherapy-rated gloves), compounding in a negative-pressure hood, and disposing of cytotoxic substances based on national standards and institutional policies.</para>

    <para id="para-00004">Chemotherapy may be given for many different reasons. Often, it is given as a curative measure to eradicate all malignant cells. However, cure is not always realistic. When cure is not attainable, chemotherapy can be used to decrease tumor size and prevent metastasis, and sometimes it may be used for palliation and symptom control. Differing regimens of chemotherapy are used for varying client needs (see <link target-id="table-00001" document="m00251"/>).</para>

    <title>Phases of Chemotherapy</title>
    <para id="para-00006">There are three phases of chemotherapy, beginning with induction. This phase is also known as first-line, front-line, or primary therapy. During this phase, the goal is to induce a remission. For most tumors, this may be the only phase required. For hematological cancers, clients may undergo a second phase, called consolidation, intensification, or post-remission therapy. This phase is used after a remission has been achieved, with a goal of eradicating any remaining cancer cells. The third phase, the maintenance phase, may be used either after induction or after consolidation. In this phase, a maintenance dose of chemotherapy is given to prevent reoccurrence of cancer. This phase is the longest phase and may last for several years.</para>

    <title>Routes of Chemotherapy Administration</title>
    <para id="para-00007">Chemotherapy may be administered by different routes depending on the purpose and toxicities of each individual drug. These different routes include oral, intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intracavitary, topically, and intrathecally. Intracavitary administration involves the infusion of a chemotherapeutic agent into a body cavity such as the bladder or abdomen. Intrathecal administration involves instilling chemotherapy into the spinal column or intracranially to treat cancers in the central nervous system. For drugs that are <term id="term-00008">vesicants</term>, which have the ability to cause necrosis if they <term id="term-00009">extravasate</term>, the intravenous route must be used. When a vesicant drug is being administered, slow administration in a rate/minute modality and vigilant assessment of the intravenous infusion site must be performed. Maintaining patency of the administration site is paramount to preventing tissue injury (see <link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00251"/>).</para>

    <title>Types of Chemotherapy</title>
    <para id="para-00010">There are many different classifications of chemotherapy drugs, many of which fall into one of two broad categories—cell-cycle specific and cell-cycle nonspecific therapies. Each cell goes through five phases of mitosis before producing daughter cells (see <link target-id="fig-00002" document="m00251"/>). Chemotherapy agents that cause cancer cell death in all phases of mitosis are referred to as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">cell-cycle nonspecific (CCNS)</term>, whereas those that are effective only in one phase of mitosis are called <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">cell-cycle specific agents (CCS)</term>. In combination chemotherapy, both CCS and NCCS agents are used to eliminate cancer cells more completely.</para>

    <media alt="A diagram shows one complete cell cycle. In the mitotic phase, mitosis and cytokinesis occurs, causing the formation of two daughter cells.

    <title>Side Effects of Chemotherapy</title>
    <para id="para-00011">Side effects of chemotherapy vary from client to client and drug to drug. However, most chemotherapies have overlapping side effects. Each of these side effects must be managed appropriately to protect the client and promote positive outcomes. Nurses who care for clients receiving chemotherapy must possess excellent assessment skills to recognize and treat these side effects early.</para>
    <para id="para-00012">Most chemotherapies work by interrupting DNA or RNA synthesis. These chemicals are most effective in eliminating cells that are most rapidly reproducing, with high mitotic rates. Unfortunately, chemotherapy cannot tell the difference in cells that are abnormally dividing versus normally rapidly dividing; therefore, the client may experience effects on normal cells as well. This includes hair, nails, skin, mucus membranes, the lining of the gastrointestinal system, and, most importantly, the stem cells within the bone marrow.</para>
    <section id="sect-00009">
    <title>Major Side Effects</title>
    <para id="para-00013">Most chemotherapy agents have major side effects in common. These include myelosuppression, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">alopecia</term>, nausea and vomiting, skin or nail changes, and late-term effect, including <term id="term-00013">secondary cancers</term>. <term id="term-00014">Myelosuppression</term> is one of the most common effects of chemotherapy. This occurs as chemotherapy affects the stem cells in the bone marrow, resulting in decreased production of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Myelosuppression affecting red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets all together is referred to as <term id="term-00015">pancytopenia</term>. Without proper support during this myelosuppression, clients may experience sepsis, bleeding, and hypoxemia, which may result in increased mortality rates. Frequent monitoring of the client’s complete blood count is imperative. In some regimens, pancytopenia may happen very rapidly, in just a few days, while with other regimens, myelosuppression may not occur for 7–14 days or longer. The <term id="term-00016">nadir</term> period, or lowest point of myelosuppression, differs for each specific chemotherapy. Clients must be monitored closely after receiving myelosuppressive therapies for the nadir period, which predisposes clients to safety issues including infection, bleeding, impaired oxygenation, and falls. Protective measures must be instituted to prevent these from occurring, and the nurse must teach clients self-care principles (see Client Teaching Guidelines).</para>

    <para id="para-00016"><term id="term-00017">Neutropenia</term>, <term id="term-00018">leukopenia</term>, and <term id="term-00019">granulocytopenia</term> occur when the white cell indices (<term id="term-00020">neutrophils</term>, <term id="term-00021">leukocytes</term>, <term id="term-00022">granulocytes</term>) are decreased. This is typically defined as having an absolute neutrophil count less than 1.5 cells/mcL. When this occurs, the client may be prescribed prophylactic antibiotic therapy that may include broad-spectrum gram-positive, broad-spectrum gram-negative, and/or antifungal agents to assist in preventing sepsis. (See <link document="m00302">Anti-Infective Drugs</link>.) Clients with neutropenia present a fragile and complicated situation, especially in regard to nursing care and assessments. It is common for severely neutropenic clients to acquire infections, and even sepsis, with few clinical symptoms. Vigilant nursing assessment is a priority in preventing negative client outcomes. With low white blood cell counts, normal immune responses to infection may be absent. For example, a client who has developed a local infection at a central venous access site would normally display warmth, redness, and edema at the site. However, that same client, when experiencing neutropenia, would not exhibit these symptoms. During this time of decreased immunity, clients may also be treated with biologic colony stimulating agents such as filgrastim or pegfilgrastim. These drugs stimulate increases in stem cell production of white blood cells, accelerating a client’s recovery from white blood cell destruction.</para>

When it occurs, febrile neutropenia should become first priority for assessment and intervention. The health care provider should be called immediately. Typically, blood cultures will be obtained, and the client will begin empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics. Failure to recognize and treat febrile neutropenia may result in life-threatening sepsis.</para>

Red blood cells function to carry oxygen to tissues, remove carbon dioxide from tissues, and provide volume within the intravascular space. When red blood cell counts decrease, clients may become hypoxemic when there are not enough red blood cells to transport oxygen. This results in fatigue and shortness of breath. Hypovolemia also occurs, in which decreased numbers of circulating red blood cells cause lowered vascular pressure. Clients may then experience orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, and disequilibrium. Clients may require transfusions of packed red blood cells, hydration with isotonic intravenous fluids, and oxygen. To decrease the occurrence of erythrocytopenia, clients may be given biologic colony stimulators to increase red blood cell production. These include epoetin alfa and darbepoetin.</para>

    <para id="para-00024">Alopecia, or hair loss, is a side effect of some chemotherapies. Drugs such as doxorubicin damage hair follicles, which results in partial or complete hair loss. While this is not usually permanent, it will last throughout the duration of the treatments. Although this is not harmful for the client physically, it may be very difficult for a client emotionally and socially. Hair loss ultimately affects body image and self-esteem and may cause others to be uncomfortable around the client. Regrowth of hair usually begins within 6 months after treatments have finished (American Cancer Society, 2021).</para>
    <para id="para-00025">Skin and nail changes may occur with administration of some types of cancer treatments. Skin rashes (erythema) or peeling of the skin on the hands and feet may occur. Hyperpigmentation of the skin and nail beds may develop as well. Tactile effects may cause neuropathic pain or increased sensitivity to cold. Nails may break, crack, or fall off. The nurse must provide care to prevent the development of infection should the nails or skin become broken.</para>
    <para id="para-00026">Chemotherapy-associated nausea and vomiting is another common side effect and can vary from drug to drug and client to client. Risk factors for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting include female sex, clients who experienced nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, age less than 50 years, and incidence of nausea and vomiting with previous chemotherapy treatments. Dehydration and electrolyte imbalances are also associated with increased nausea and vomiting. While there is pharmacological support for nausea and vomiting, some chemotherapeutic agents continue to cause significant negative effects. Nausea and vomiting may occur as anticipatory, beginning before a treatment begins, or during or soon after a treatment. Some agents like cisplatin may cause delayed nausea and vomiting, defined as occurring more than 24 hours after administration. This may last 5 days or more. Management of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting includes efforts to maintain client comfort, adequate hydration, and electrolyte balance. Antiemetics such as ondansetron and aprepitant may be given before, during, and after treatment. Nutritional support to help maintain adequate intake of required nutrients and prevent chemotherapy-related cachexia (“wasting syndrome”) accompanies the management of nausea and vomiting.</para>
    <para id="para-00027">For clients undergoing chemotherapy, another complication involves long-term effects. Most chemotherapy treatments effectively begin both therapeutic and untoward effects as soon as they are administered. The acute effects may last throughout the treatment period and for a few months afterward. However, the cumulative effects of repeated cycles of treatment often result in effects that persist and even worsen over many years. Long-term effects typically involve decreased pulmonary and cardiac function, but other effects such as infertility may be seen.</para>
    <para id="para-00028">In addition to monitoring for late-term effects of chemotherapies, clients must be evaluated for recurrence of disease and for development of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029">secondary cancers</term>. Recurrence of a tumor happens when cells of the original cancer return and begin growing despite treatment modalities. Secondary cancers differ from recurrent cancer in that these tumors develop in different tissues than the original cancer. Chemotherapeutic agents, unfortunately, are carcinogens. Receiving chemotherapeutic agents for cancer treatment places a client at risk of developing other types of cancers known as secondary cancers. For cancer survivors, follow-up care includes continued surveillance to assess for these effects.</para>

    <title>Alkylating Drugs</title>
    <para id="para-00029"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00030">Alkylating agents</term> are among the oldest group of chemotherapies. They were developed after World War I when it was noted that these substances, when used as weapons, caused myelosuppression. Upon this discovery, they were developed into chemotherapeutic agents. In general, the medications in this class kill cancer cells by cross-linking DNA, which produces a suicide-like effect on cancer cells. These agents work most effectively on slower-growing tumors with a slowed mitotic rate. Alkylating agents are separated into several different subclasses. Some of these medications are dosed based on the client’s weight, and others are administered based on the client’s body surface area (BSA), which is determined using a formula using the client’s height and weight (mg/m<sup>2</sup>).</para>
    <section id="sect-00011">
    <title>Subclass 1: Nitrogen Mustards</title>
    <para id="para-00030">In use today are five alkylating agents that are classified as nitrogen mustards. These include mechlorethamine, melphalan, chlorambucil, ifosfamide, and cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide is the most widely used nitrogen mustard and can be found in the regimens for many different cancers. Cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide pose the risk of <term id="term-00031">hemorrhagic cystitis</term>, usually when high-dose therapy is used. To prevent this, a rescue agent, or uroprotectant, is given to prevent bladder irritation. <term id="term-00032">Mesna</term> is the rescue agent used with these drugs for supportive interventions to prevent bladder complications.</para>

    <section id="sect-00012">
    <title>Subclass 2: Nitrosoureas</title>
    <para id="para-00031">Nitrosoureas are classified as alkylating agents, yet these have an advantage that nitrogen mustards do not: they cross the blood–brain barrier. This characteristic allows these drugs to pass into the brain, treating cancers like glioblastomas and other brain tumors. Carmustine is a more commonly used intravenous nitrosourea. Lomustine, which is similar to carmustine, is administered via oral routes.</para>

    <section id="sect-00013">
    <title>Subclass 3: Alkyl Sulfonates</title>
    <para id="para-00032">Alkyl sulfonates such as busulfan are administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion rather than IV push. These are very potent drugs, used to treat chronic leukemia, and they have severe adverse effects. These include myelosuppression, stomatitis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and electrolyte imbalances including hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia. Busulfan requires very close pharmacokinetic monitoring and dose alteration.</para>
    <para id="para-00033">Chemotherapy, while it acts to target cell functions and reproduction, may cause widespread undesired damage to normal cells. For this reason, many chemotherapeutic agents have black box warnings. These warnings are used to emphasize the most serious and potentially damaging side effects of a drug or a class of drugs. Boxed warnings are set specifically to make clients and health care providers aware of very serious risks of using certain medications. With chemotherapeutics, there are multiple reasons that a boxed warning may be issued. However, the most common reasons include myelosuppression, teratogenicity, and hypersensitivity reactions. Prior to administering a chemotherapeutic drug, nurses should check for boxed warnings so that drugs may be administered safely and clients may be educated regarding these warnings.</para>

    <title>Adverse Effects and Contraindications</title>
    <para id="para-00035">Alkylating agents are some of the most toxic chemotherapies used in cancer treatment. One benefit of these toxicities is that drugs like busulfan can be used to eradicate bone-marrow production prior to stem-cell and bone-marrow transplants. This reduces recurrence of the primary disease after transplant. However, alkylating agents are known for the negative effects associated with administration of these drugs. Short-term side effects include myelosuppression, which usually occurs 6–10 days after administration, with recovery after 14–21 days. Myelosuppression resulting in neutropenia can result in severe infections and sepsis. <term id="term-00052">Mucositis</term>, nausea, and vomiting are side effects that affect the client’s overall nutritional status. Neurotoxicity and alopecia are also short-term side effects. Long-term (delayed) effects of alkylating agents include pulmonary fibrosis, infertility, and secondary malignancies (Amjad &amp; Kasi, 2020). These long-term effects may occur months after treatment or may develop many years later.</para>

    <title>Antimetabolites</title>
    <para id="para-00048">Antimetabolite chemotherapies are a group of drugs that prevent cancer cell growth by imitating metabolites, which are substances necessary for tumor cell growth. Cancer cells use these substances, which, once inside the cell, prevent DNA replication. This results in cell death. Within this class, there are three types of metabolites that are inhibited: purines, pyrimidines, and folic acid. Each drug in this class specifically targets replacement of one of these substances. The most common drugs within this class are fluorouracil, fludarabine, gemcitabine, and methotrexate. Common side effects include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, stomatitis, alopecia, and myelosuppression. Antimetabolites are useful in treating leukemias, lymphomas, and cancers of the gastrointestinal and biliary tracts.</para>

    <title>Adverse Effects and Contraindications</title>
    <para id="para-00050">Antimetabolites are associated with many adverse effects. Folate antimetabolites are associated with myelosuppression, mucositis, hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and cutaneous reactions. Pyrimidine antimetabolites cause mucositis and myelosuppression as well but are also associated with dose-limiting hand-foot syndrome and diarrhea. Contraindications for fluorouracil include clients with dihydropyridine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency, which may result in toxic levels of fluorouracil. This can lead to cardiac dysfunction, colitis, neutropenia, and encephalopathy. Uridine triacetate is used to treat toxicity in these clients. Cytarabine is associated with inflammation of the conjunctiva. Corticosteroid eye drops are used prophylactically to prevent this. Purine antimetabolites, in addition to causing myelosuppression, also decrease the CD4 lymphocyte count, resulting in immunosuppression and risk of opportunistic infections (Amjad &amp; Kasi, 2020).</para>

    <title>Anthracyclines/Antitumor Antibiotics</title>
    <para id="para-00061">Anthracyclines are some of the most potent chemotherapies on the market today. These drugs are very strong vesicants that cause severe necrosis when extravasated. Three major drugs in this class are daunorubicin, doxorubicin, and epirubicin. These drugs cause cell death by preventing DNA replication. They do this by inhibiting topoisomerase, leaving DNA strands unable to unwind and replicate. The major side effects of anthracyclines are myelosuppression, nausea and vomiting, alopecia, skin and nail hyperpigmentation, and, most notably, cardiotoxicity. Many drugs in this class are red in color and can resultingly cause urine and other body fluids to turn red/orange. This is a benign side effect but is usually discussed with clients to avoid any panic. These drugs are assigned maximum lifetime dose limits to aid in preventing debilitating chemotherapy-induced heart failure. Additionally, clients must have a left ventricular ejection fraction of at least 55% to receive these drugs. <link target-id="table-00007" document="m00251"/> lists common anthracyclines/antitumor antibiotics and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.</para>

    <title>Plant Alkaloids</title>
    <para id="para-00067">Several chemotherapies are derived from plants and are considered <term id="term-00090">plant alkaloids</term>. Vinca alkaloids are the most common plant alkaloids. Vincristine, vinblastine, and etoposide (VP-16) are all plant alkaloids that cause misalignment of chromosomes in cancer cells, resulting in apoptosis, or cell death. These are useful in treating lymphomas, leukemias, Kaposi sarcoma, squamous cell carcinomas, lung cancer, and bladder cancer. Side effects include myelosuppression, mouth sores, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. The most significant adverse effects involve the nervous system. Because plant alkaloids decrease nerve function, these substances can cause hearing loss, neuropathies, and severe constipation that may develop into a paralytic ileus. Neurologic symptoms may necessitate discontinuance of therapy. Vinca alkaloids are often part of regimens that also require intrathecal administration. However, close attention and safety measures (i.e., drug is always compounded in an IV bag for infusion) must be in place to ensure these are <emphasis effect="italics">never</emphasis> administered via the intrathecal route. The drugs are fatal if administered intrathecally.</para>

    <title>Taxanes</title>
    <para id="para-00074"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00097">Taxanes</term> are a group of chemotherapeutic agents that were developed from the bark of a yew tree. These are effective in the treatment of breast, ovarian, prostate, gastric, esophageal, pancreatic, and non-small cell lung cancers as well as Kaposi sarcoma. These agents are typically used in combination with other agents rather than as a monotherapy. Adverse reactions include, most notably, hypersensitivity reactions. For this reason, clients will be premedicated, usually with corticosteroids, but may also receive diphenhydramine and a histamine-2 receptor antagonist to prevent these reactions from occurring. Other adverse effects include hepatotoxicity, fluid retention, myelosuppression, alopecia, skin and nail changes, and nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.</para>

    <title>Adverse Effects and Contraindications</title>
    <para id="para-00076">Taxanes are most known for the adverse effect of hypersensitivity reactions. A test dose and premedication with antihistamines and acetaminophen may be used prior administration. Myelosuppression may result in lowered levels of platelets and white blood cells. Taxanes are contraindicated in solid tumors with myelosuppression with neutrophil counts under 1500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. Peripheral neuropathy is also commonly associated with taxanes, resulting in pain and limited movement. Fatigue and arthralgias are also seen with these drugs. Cardiovascular changes including hypotension, bradycardia, hypertension, and electrocardiogram (ECG, EKG) changes may be noted (DailyMed, <emphasis effect="italics">Paclitaxel</emphasis>, 2023).</para>

The advent of biologic colony stimulating factors marked a significant decrease in sepsis-related deaths for clients receiving chemotherapy. Ondansetron, specifically, has greatly changed the way chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting are treated. Traditional phenothiazines cause vein and tissue irritation as well as central nervous system depression, placing a client at risk for injury. Ondansetron does not affect central nervous system function, reducing the risk of falls and other injuries.</para>
