<title>Pathophysiology of Heart Failure</title>
<para id="para-00002">The importance of cardiac output cannot be stressed enough; it is necessary for every organ in the body. <term id="term-00001">Cardiac output</term> is a function of heart rate (HR) and stroke volume (SV): <m:math><m:mi>CO</m:mi><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:mi>HR</m:mi><m:mo> </m:mo><m:mo>×</m:mo><m:mo> </m:mo><m:mi>SV</m:mi></m:math>. Normal resting CO is 4–5 liters per minute. <term id="term-00002">Heart rate</term> is the number of times the heart beats per minute. <term id="term-00003">Stroke volume</term> is the amount of blood pumped out of the left ventricle with each heartbeat. Stroke volume is a function of preload, afterload, and contractility. <term id="term-00004">Preload</term> is the volume of blood returning to the heart, <term id="term-00005">afterload</term> is the amount of pressure that the left ventricle must push against, and <term id="term-00006">contractility</term> is the ability of the left ventricle to squeeze or pump blood. Stroke volume is often measured by <term id="term-00007">ejection fraction</term>, or the percentage of blood that is pumped out of the left ventricle with each beat (Hajouli &amp; Ludhwani, 2022). It is important to note that the entire volume of the left ventricle is not pumped out with each beat; a small portion remains in the chamber. Factors affecting cardiac output can be seen in <link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00319"/>.</para>
<figure id="fig-00001">
<media alt="This figure lists the different factors affecting the heart rate and stroke volume. It also shows how they both affect the cardiac output. The factors affecting heart rate are autonomic innervation, hormones, fitness levels, and age. Factors affecting stroke volume are heart size, fitness levels, gender, contractility, duration of contraction, preload or EDV, and afterload (resistance). Stroke volume is calculated by subtracting end systolic volume from end diastolic volume. Cardiac output equals heart rate times stroke volume.">

<para id="para-00003">In order for the heart to produce adequate stroke volume, the left ventricle must be able to fill well (preload) and squeeze well (contractility). Contractility requires adequate muscle tissue (adequate cardiac myocytes), which must receive an adequate blood supply. So, the heart itself is dependent on cardiac output.</para>
<para id="para-00004"><term id="term-00008">Heart failure</term> occurs when the heart is no longer able to generate an adequate cardiac output. Heart failure is a result of ventricular dysfunction; something has affected ventricular preload or contractility in such a way that the ventricle is no longer able to expel blood effectively (Malik et al., 2022). This leads to decreased perfusion of all tissues. There are two ways in which the heart is not able to maintain cardiac output. One is caused by a reduced ejection fraction and is called <term id="term-00009">heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)</term>. The other, called <term id="term-00010">heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)</term>, occurs when the actual ejection fraction is not reduced but cardiac output is still decreased.</para>
<section id="sect-00004">
<title>Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction</title>
<para id="para-00005">Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction is a problem stemming from inadequate contractility. It is the most common type of heart failure. There are multiple causes of HFrEF, including coronary artery disease and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Both cause decreased oxygenation to the individual cardiac muscle cells or cardiac myocytes. Because the cardiac myocytes have less oxygen than they need, they are not able to contract well. In the case of an AMI, the myocytes have had their oxygen supply cut off, and so there is cell death. Dead myocytes don’t contract at all.</para>
<para id="para-00006">Hypertension is also a common cause of HFrEF. Long-standing untreated hypertension increases afterload and causes the left ventricle to work harder to eject blood. Initially, the left ventricle can hypertrophy (thicken) to push against the increased resistance (see <link target-id="fig-00002" document="m00319"/>). After many years, the left ventricular hypertrophy can’t keep up with the increased resistance, and the heart is unable to maintain an adequate cardiac output. Because contractility and afterload are considered part of systole, this was traditionally referred to as <emphasis effect="italics">systolic heart failure</emphasis>.</para>
<figure id="fig-00002">

<section id="sect-00005">
<title>Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction</title>
<para id="para-00007">Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction stems from muscle stiffness. As people age, muscles can become stiff and not move as well as they did in younger years. This also can happen to the left ventricle; the muscle tissue can become stiff, which does not allow for adequate ventricular opening. If the ventricles cannot open well, then they cannot fill well. If the ventricle cannot fill well, this decreases preload, which then decreases stroke volume.</para>
<para id="para-00008">Recall that ejection fraction (EF) is the percentage of blood pumped from the heart with each beat (EF &#61; blood ejected from the left ventricle &#247; total volume of blood in the left ventricle at the end of diastole). In HFpEF, less blood fills the ventricle during diastole (thus there is lower total volume at the end of diastole/lower preload, the denominator in the above equation), and less blood is pumped out of the left ventricle (lower stroke volume and thus lower cardiac output, the numerator in the above equation). Therefore, both the denominator and numerator of the equation change proportionally and the ratio, or ejection fraction, remains the same despite cardiac output being lower. Hence the name heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Because preload is considered part of diastole (or ventricular filling), this type of heart failure traditionally was referred to as <emphasis effect="italics">diastolic heart failure</emphasis>.</para>
<para id="para-00009">The main treatment for HFpEF is control of hypertension and other comorbidities, if present. (Hypertension is discussed in more detail in <link document="m00313">Antihypertensive and Antianginal Drugs</link>.) Nearly all pharmacologic treatments for heart failure are specific to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. The Pharmacologic Treatment of Heart Failure section will pertain to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.</para>

<title>Classification and Staging of Heart Failure</title>
<para id="para-00010">Heart failure is diagnosed based on ejection fraction and symptoms. The American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC)/Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA) Guidelines state that a normal ejection fraction is between 50% and 70% (Heidenreich et al., 2022). If a person has an ejection fraction of less than 40%, a diagnosis of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction is made. Heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction means that a person has symptoms of heart failure but the ejection fraction is between 41% and 50%. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is diagnosed when there are symptoms of heart failure but the ejection fraction is still in the normal range (see <link target-id="table-00001" document="m00319"/>).</para>

<title>Diagnostics</title>
<para id="para-00012">It can be difficult to diagnose heart failure because it is based on symptom recognition. People often have symptoms but don’t recognize them as a manifestation of heart failure. In order for heart failure to be diagnosed, a health care provider must do a thorough history and physical exam. If there are signs and symptoms of heart failure, the provider will order an echocardiogram. In an echocardiogram, sound waves are used to assess how well the heart is pumping and to determine the heart’s ejection fraction. Other tests that may be performed include an electrocardiogram to assess cardiac rhythm and blood work. Typical blood work includes a basic metabolic profile, which will include information on electrolytes and kidney function. One other blood test that is often included is a brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) to determine whether the heart is undergoing increased stretch. When cardiac myocytes are stretched too far, they release BNP (Novack &amp; Zevitz, 2022). This test often helps providers determine the stage of heart failure.</para>

<section id="sect-00008">
<title>Clinical Manifestations</title>
<para id="para-00013">Heart failure often occurs after another disease process has damaged the cardiovascular system. The most common causes of HFrEF are coronary artery disease, acute myocardial infarction, and prolonged hypertension. The most common cause of HFpEF is aging. Therefore, heart failure is often a disease of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">older age</term>, though it is not exclusive to that age group. Symptoms associated with heart failure include shortness of breath, edema, exercise intolerance, and fatigue. Often people with heart failure have an increased heart rate due to the body’s compensatory mechanisms. Remember: <m:math><m:mi>CO</m:mi><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:mi>HR</m:mi><m:mo> </m:mo><m:mo>×</m:mo><m:mo> </m:mo><m:mi>SV</m:mi></m:math>. If stroke volume is decreased, then the body will compensate by increasing heart rate.</para>
</section>
<section id="sect-00009">
<title>Nonpharmacologic Treatment of Heart Failure</title>
<para id="para-00014">Nonpharmacologic treatments for heart failure include sodium restriction. A sodium-restricted diet (less than 2000 mg of sodium per day) may help maintain euvolemia (normal blood volume) and prevent clients from becoming overloaded with fluid (which presents as pitting edema in the extremities, abdominal edema, and/or pulmonary edema). It is also important for people with heart failure to eat a healthy diet and exercise as well as they are able. Additionally, smoking cessation, reduced or no use of alcohol, and self-monitoring of signs and symptoms may be helpful.</para>
<section id="sect-00010">
<title>Dietary Modification</title>
<para id="para-00015">Dietary modification for clients with heart failure are similar to those for clients with hypertension (see <link document="m00313">Antihypertensive and Antianginal Drugs</link>). Clients with heart failure should follow a 2000 mg/day sodium-restricted diet and are often instructed to record the amount of sodium they consume daily. Clients should be instructed on how to read Nutrition Facts labels on food in order to determine the amount of sodium per serving or per container. Clients should be made aware that most processed foods are very high in sodium. Fast food, processed frozen meals, and canned foods all have very high sodium content. The client can be referred to the <link url="https://openstax.org/r/recipesheart">American Heart Association’s recipe collection</link> for low-sodium, heart-healthy meals.</para>
<para id="para-00016">Clients who take certain medications for heart failure (discussed later in this chapter) should be instructed to avoid foods high in potassium, such as bananas and watermelon, as well as salt substitutes because most substitute potassium for sodium.</para>
</section>
<section id="sect-00011">
<title>Physical Activity and Exercise</title>
<para id="para-00017">Clients with heart failure often experience shortness of breath and fatigue with exercise; however, they should be encouraged to exercise as much as they are able. Many clients with heart failure are not able to fully follow the exercise recommendations of the American Heart Association (see <link document="m00313">Antihypertensive and Antianginal Drugs</link>), but they can be encouraged to follow an individualized exercise plan. As an alternative, the health care provider may enroll them in cardiac rehabilitation to build their exercise tolerance.</para>
</section>
<section id="sect-00012">
<title>Smoking Cessation and Reducing Alcohol Consumption</title>
<para id="para-00018">Clients should be encouraged to stop using any tobacco products and/or alcohol. Both can cause heart failure exacerbations. For more information on smoking cessation and decreasing alcohol consumption, see <link document="m00313">Antihypertensive and Antianginal Drugs</link>.</para>
</section>
<section id="sect-00013">
<title>Self-Monitoring of Heart Failure Symptoms</title>
<para id="para-00019">Clients with heart failure should monitor their symptoms daily. This includes weighing themselves every day, monitoring how well they are breathing, assessing for lower extremity swelling, and determining their level of fatigue. Clients should notify their health care provider if they gain 2–3 pounds in one day or 5 pounds in one week or if they notice increased swelling in their extremities, difficulty breathing, and/or chest pain. The <link url="https://openstax.org/r/heartorgen">American Heart Association website</link> (n.d.) has many interactive resources available to help clients monitor their symptoms, including a phone app.</para>

</section>
<section id="sect-00014">
<title>Pharmacologic Treatment of Heart Failure</title>
<para id="para-00020">The primary goal of treatment for clients with heart failure is to reduce morbidity and mortality. Another goal is to decrease the cardiac workload and the heart’s demand for oxygen. There are five guideline-directed classifications of medications for HFrEF (Heidenreich et al., 2022):</para>

<para id="para-00021">ACE inhibitors, ARBs, ARNIs, and MRAs all affect some component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and are grouped together in Section 19.2.

SGLT2Is were primarily used to treat type 2 diabetes but recently were found to be useful in heart failure. Clients with heart failure often have volume overload, so it is also important to control symptoms that are caused by volume overload. Diuretics are part of first-line treatment and are used to modify symptoms of fluid volume overload.</para>
