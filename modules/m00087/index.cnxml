    <title>Holistic Nursing Assessment of the Client</title>
    <para id="para-00002">Maintaining overall health within the musculoskeletal and integumentary systems is critical to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">holistic health</term>. One way to attain this goal is to review specific nutritional plans with the client. Some plans, such as gluten free or Mediterranean, are found to be helpful in decreasing the symptoms associated with musculoskeletal and integumentary disorders. Some research suggests there is an inflammatory immune response related to gluten—a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye grains. Some people may find that eating gluten makes their rheumatoid arthritis symptoms flare up and that reducing or eliminating gluten helps relieve their symptoms. Another anti-inflammatory nutritional plan, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">Mediterranean diet</term>, which emphasizes fresh fruits and vegetables, fish, whole grains, nuts, and mono- and polyunsaturated fats, is helpful for reducing <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">inflammation</term> and works well to reduce arthritis symptoms. This diet plan includes omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin C, fiber-rich foods, <term id="term-00004">polyphenols</term>, and other known inflammation fighters. Polyphenols, found in various foods, are organic compounds that contribute to the food’s color and smell. The nurse should ensure the client understands the premise behind the nutritional plan and that they can read and interpret food labels and ingredients properly.</para>
    <para id="para-00003">The client must also be assessed for readiness to learn. This can be accomplished through a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">holistic assessment</term>—an in-depth client assessment that delves into the following areas:</para>
    <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00002">
    <item>Physiological health—Physical condition, physical limitations, medical conditions, past medical and surgical history, and current medications</item>
    <item>Psychological health—Mental health condition, cognitive level, anxiety, stress</item>
    <item>Social and environmental—Support systems, living conditions, financial barriers, access to resources</item>
    <item>Cultural factors—Traditions, languages, set of beliefs</item>
    <item>Spiritual factors—Alcohol consumption, dietary choices, procedures allowed, advanced directives</item>
    </list>
    <para id="para-00004">By working with the client to establish holistic goals for good health, client/nurse communication is enhanced, and trust is established. Holistic nursing provides a deeper respect for the client and helps them gain control over their lifestyle changes.</para>
    <para id="para-00005">As a part of the physiological health assessment, the nurse should determine the client’s list of medications. As a part of client teaching, the nurse should educate the client about the medications that have been prescribed for treatment. Some of the most ordered medications for musculoskeletal disorders include <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">NSAIDS</term> like ibuprofen, diclofenac, naproxen, indomethacin, meloxicam, and others.</para>
    </section>
    <section id="sect-00004">
    <title>Client Teaching</title>
    <para id="para-00006">When a client is hospitalized, teaching starts at admission and is an ongoing process throughout the stay until discharge. Education should be provided in small segments for better client retention. Nurses should speak in a language that the client can understand, refraining from using complex medical terminology. In some instances, return demonstration is needed right before discharge. The nurse should educate according to the learning style of the client and should include the caretakers who will be assisting the client once home (Morris, 2022).</para>
    <para id="para-00007"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">Client teaching</term> should always include nutritionally related teaching strategies. Too often at discharge, the nurse focuses on the physical problem exclusively. Nutritional client education that focuses on the musculoskeletal and integumentary system is a more holistic approach to treatment. See <link target-id="table-00001" document="m00087"/> for important nutritional teaching concerning both the integumentary and musculoskeletal systems.</para>

    <para id="para-00008">As seen in the table above, both the musculoskeletal and the integumentary systems are affected by <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">inflammation</term>. Therefore, anti-inflammatory foods are important to consider for both systems. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">muscles</term> of the musculoskeletal system can become inflamed due to injury, infection, or overuse. Likewise, the soft tissue and skin of the integumentary system can become inflamed due to injury or infection. The injured muscle often involves the surrounding tissue and skin. Bones that are injured (fractures) often manifest signs in the integumentary system such as bruising, and discoloration. The injured tendons and ligaments of the musculoskeletal system manifest signs in the integumentary system such as ecchymosis and edema. These are just a few examples of how the musculoskeletal system and the integumentary system are connected to one another.</para>

    <para id="para-00010">The nurse prepares to instruct the client on nutritional strategies to manage her arthritis. Client teaching for Anne includes the reinforcement teaching of a nutritional plan that has anti-inflammatory properties for her osteoarthritis with edema in the knees. Along with nutritional education, the nurse instructs the client to stay as active as possible, doing stretching exercises daily as prescribed by the physical therapist to maintain or gain ROM in lower extremities. The nurse instructs Anne to pay close attention to the skin surrounding her knees, observing for warmth or redness. Anne is encouraged to report these integumentary symptoms if they occur because they could indicate septic arthritis of the knees.</para>
