      <para id="para-00001"><term id="term-00001">Diabetes</term> is a long-term chronic health condition that affects millions of people worldwide. It alters how the body regulates glucose from food and uses it for energy. Diabetes affects people of all races, sexes, and ages. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, n.d.-a), diabetes and diabetes-related health complications can be serious and costly. The eighth leading cause of death in the United States, diabetes costs a total estimated $327 billion in medical costs and lost work and wages (CDC, n.d.-a). Along with dietary modifications, diabetes management includes <term id="term-00002">insulin</term>, <term id="term-00003">non-insulin injectable diabetes drugs</term>, and <term id="term-00004">oral diabetes drugs</term>. This chapter will explore diabetes and the pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments for this disease process.</para>
