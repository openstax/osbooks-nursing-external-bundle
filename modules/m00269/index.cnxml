<para id="para-00002"><term id="term-00001">Anxiety</term> can be described as a feeling of nervousness, apprehension, and/or worry about a future threat. Anxiety disorders involve excessive fear and anxiety and corresponding behaviors (American Psychiatric Association, 2022). Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), social anxiety disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are examples of anxiety disorders. Anxiety is considered pathological if it is (1) disproportionate to events, (2) sustained over a significant time period, (3) significantly impairing function during usual activities of daily living, and (4) apparently unrelated to any identifiable event or situation. Pathological levels of anxiety require treatment and usually will not fully resolve without therapeutic intervention. Clinical manifestations of anxiety are related to the activation of the sympathetic nervous system response. These include muscle tension, restless feeling, trembling, difficulty concentrating, irritability, tachycardia, palpitations, diaphoresis, dry mouth, dyspnea, and dizziness. Untreated high levels of anxiety predispose people to other comorbidities, such as hypertension, substance use, or depression. These high levels can impair memory, perception, judgment, and motor responses.</para>
<para id="para-00003">A simplistic explanation related to the pathophysiology of anxiety involves an excess of excitatory neurotransmitters (norepinephrine) or a deficiency of inhibitory neurotransmitters (GABA). Most of the medications known to improve symptoms of anxiety act directly or indirectly on the GABA system. Benzodiazepines are widely used for short-term treatment until the prescribed antidepressant reaches therapeutic levels. (Antidepressants were discussed earlier in the chapter.)</para>
<para id="para-00004">Sleep is essential for body restoration. During sleep, tissue repair, synthesis of skeletal muscle protein, and secretion of growth hormone occur. Insomnia is the inability to obtain an adequate amount of sleep needed to function efficiently during the day. Insomnia may be situational, lasting a few days to a few weeks. Insomnia disorder, however, is defined as a significant inability to initiate sleep (<term id="term-00002">sleep latency</term>) or maintain sleep, or early morning awakening with the inability to return to sleep (American Psychiatric Association, 2022). The occurrence is at least 3 nights/week and is present for at least 1 month and may persist for longer than 3 months. Insomnia disorder leads to increased morbidity (such as psychosis) and mortality. Many clients with insomnia have high rates of depression and anxiety.</para>
<para id="para-00005">Drug therapy includes benzodiazepines and the nonbenzodiazepine sedatives. <term id="term-00003">Anxiolytics</term> (antianxiety drugs) and <term id="term-00004">sedative-hypnotics</term> (drugs to invoke relaxation and produce sleep) are CNS depressants that have similar effects. The difference between the effects depends largely on the dose. Large doses of antianxiety and sedative-hypnotic agents produce sleep, and small doses of sedative-hypnotics have anxiolytic or sedative effects.</para>
<section id="sect-00003">
<title>Benzodiazepines</title>
<para id="para-00006"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">Benzodiazepines</term> are usually prescribed on a short-term basis for disabling anxiety and are considered second-line therapy due to the risk of dependence. They quickly reduce or prevent anxiety without causing extreme sedation. Benzodiazepines are classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance due to their potential for abuse and physical dependency. Benzodiazepines work in the limbic system and the reticular activating system (RAS) to make GABA more effective. GABA stabilizes the postsynaptic cells, which results in the interference of neuron firing.</para>
<para id="para-00007">When treating anxiety, a lower dose is necessary compared to when using it for sedative purposes. In addition to anxiety, these medications can be used for alcohol withdrawal, agitation, and seizure disorders. These drugs must be tapered slowly when discontinuing them or the client will experience withdrawal symptoms.</para>

<title>Reversal Agent for Benzodiazepine Toxicity</title>
<para id="para-00008">Flumazenil is a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist and is beneficial in reversing the effects of benzodiazepine. It should be available for use as needed to reverse the effects of benzodiazepines administered for sedation. It is also used emergently to treat benzodiazepine overdose.</para>

<section id="sect-00004">
<title>Adverse Effects and Contraindications</title>
<para id="para-00012">Due to the prolonged half-life, both therapeutic and adverse effects are more likely to occur after 3 days of therapy. A client with a history of psychosis should avoid taking benzodiazepines due to the potential exacerbation of symptoms. Acute narrow-angle glaucoma is also a contraindication because this drug class can increase the intraocular pressure. Acute alcohol intoxication or opioid use can intensify the CNS depressant effects. Anyone who is pregnant or breastfeeding should avoid these drugs because they can easily cross the placenta and mammary glands, causing significant sedation in the fetus or infant. Benzodiazepines may produce paradoxical excitement and aggression in adults older than age 50 who have a history of psychosis. Likewise, clients with impaired hepatic function should avoid taking these medications because they are metabolized by the liver. Clients with renal impairment should avoid this drug because the active metabolites may accumulate, resulting in excessive sedation and respiratory depression. Calcium channel blockers decrease the benzodiazepine’s drug metabolism, leading to increased adverse drug effects. Cimetidine is a hepatic enzyme inhibitor. If the dose of the sedative-hypnotic is not decreased, it will accumulate and become toxic. Taking disulfiram concurrently can potentiate the effects of benzodiazepines.</para>

Clients may receive <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00042">nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotics</term> prior to diagnostic or surgical procedures or take them for sleepless nights. These drugs should only be taken when insomnia is causing distress and nonpharmacologic measures have been ineffective. They should not be taken every night unless absolutely necessary. Intermittent administration can help maintain the drug’s effectiveness and also prevent dependence. Additionally, it reduces disturbances of normal sleep patterns.</para>
<para id="para-00020">The loss of awareness to and reaction of environmental stimuli is termed <emphasis effect="italics">sedation</emphasis>. This may be a desirable characteristic for some clients who are restless, nervous, or overreactive to certain stimuli. A sedative is a drug that depresses the central nervous system (CNS). Although a sedative is used more as an anxiolytic, it frequently leads to drowsiness. A hypnotic causes extreme sedation and is used in individuals to promote sleep. These drugs act on the RAS and block the brain’s response to incoming stimuli:</para>

<item><emphasis effect="italics">Eszopiclone (Schedule IV):</emphasis> Eszopiclone is one of two drugs used long-term (12 months or longer) for chronic insomnia. Studies have shown that clients did not experience tolerance to the hypnotic benefits over a 6-month period (DailyMed, <emphasis effect="italics">Eszopiclone</emphasis>, 2022). Its mechanism of action is due to an interaction with GABA receptors close to or coupled with benzodiazepine receptors. Adverse effects associated with this drug include reduced inhibition, aggression or bizarre behavior, worsening depression and suicidal ideations, hallucinations, and <term id="term-00043">anterograde amnesia</term> (memory loss). Many clients report an unpleasant taste of the drug. Clients who take eszopiclone should allow for 8 hours of sleep because it increases total sleep time and reduces sleep latency. It has no effect on reducing nighttime awakenings. Clients should take the drug immediately prior to going to bed due to its rapid onset. The medication should not be taken immediately following a high-fat meal because it can delay the onset by 1 hour.</item>

<title>Adverse Effects and Contraindications</title>
<para id="para-00024">Clients can experience <term id="term-00059">angioedema</term> if they are allergic to any of the components in the drug. These drugs are metabolized by the liver, so they should be avoided by anyone with severe hepatic failure. Lower doses should be administered for those with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency and in the older adult. Glaucoma, psychosis, and acute alcohol intoxication can be exacerbated by the CNS depression of these drugs. Due to the potential for respiratory depression, clients with a history of COPD or sleep apnea should use caution. If taking a nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic for at least 1 week, gradual tapering is crucial when discontinuing. If stopped abruptly, withdrawal syndrome can occur including nausea, headache, vertigo, nightmares, and seizures. Rebound insomnia can potentially occur but only lasts a few days after the drug has been stopped. Essentially, it resolves on its own.</para>
<para id="para-00025">Lemborexant and daridorexant are both contraindicated for the use in narcolepsy. It has been advised that these two drugs should not be used in the presence of hepatic disease. The safety and effectiveness in those under age 18 has not been established.</para>
<para id="para-00026">Concurrently taking another CNS depressant or drinking alcohol with this medication can intensify CNS depression and cause excessive drowsiness along with respiratory depression. Both of these can increase the risk for injury.</para>
<para id="para-00027">If a client takes the medication directly after consuming a high-fat meal, it can significantly delay absorption of the drug. Herbal supplements should be avoided.</para>
