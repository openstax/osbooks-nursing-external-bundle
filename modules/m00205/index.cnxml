<para id="para-00001">On a bustling night shift at an urban hospital in a diverse city, Nurse Sampson is ready to care for a varied group of clients, each with their own cultural and personal background. With a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">client-centered</term> approach, Nurse Sampson is committed to providing the best care possible to all those he encounters.</para>
<para id="para-00002">The increasingly <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">multicultural</term> population in the United States highlights the importance of nurses recognizing and appreciating cultural differences in values, beliefs, and customs. Providing <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">culturally sensitive care</term> is essential for improving health outcomes and ensuring that health care is accessible and equitable for all clients. This chapter addresses how cultural factors may influence <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">health beliefs</term>, behaviors, practices, and health outcomes. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing that clients may have different expectations regarding communication, space, social organization, time, dietary practices/preferences, and environmental control from those held by the nurse, health care provider, and dominant culture.</para>
<para id="para-00003">The chapters in this unit make up a comprehensive guide that aims to equip nursing students and professionals with the necessary knowledge and skills to provide the best possible care to all individuals. By embracing <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">culturally responsive care</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">cultural humility</term>, nurses can navigate the complexities of cultural diversity and deliver effective and compassionate care. This, in turn, can contribute to a more equitable and accessible health care system for everyone. This chapter explores the relationship between culture and health. <link document="m00209"><emphasis effect="bold">Transcultural Nursing</emphasis></link> explores cultural models and the significance of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">cultural assessment</term> in the provision of culturally sensitive care for individuals from diverse backgrounds. <link document="m00213"><emphasis effect="bold">Culturally and Linguistically Responsive Care</emphasis></link> examines the journey toward becoming a culturally responsive nurse, while <link document="m00220"><emphasis effect="bold">Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Program Design</emphasis></link> provides practical tools for culturally responsive care. Finally, <link document="m00224"><emphasis effect="bold">Managing the Dynamics of Difference</emphasis></link> applies the nursing process to a nurse’s personal journey of becoming more culturally responsive.</para>
