<para id="para-00002">Diseases are <term id="term-00001">infectious</term> if they are easily transmitted between individuals. To understand how outbreaks of infectious diseases occur, community and public health nurses should understand disease <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">communicability</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">transmissibility</term>. Health promotion and disease prevention efforts are geared toward breaking the chain of transmission. To break this chain, nurses must implement appropriate public health measures based on the transmission mode and educate communities effectively on how to protect and prevent disease transmission. Public health nurses, like Sally, play a role in disease surveillance.</para>

<title>The Epidemiology (Communicability) of Infectious Diseases</title>
<para id="para-00003"><term id="term-00004">Infectious diseases</term> are caused by pathogenic microorganisms—agents such as bacteria, viruses, parasites, or fungi—that enter a human host, multiply, and cause infection that can spread via direct or indirect transmission (CDC, 2022ap). <link document="m00158">Epidemiology for Informing Population/Community Health Decisions</link> introduced the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">epidemiological triad</term> and the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">chain of infection</term>; both are central in the transmission of infectious disease. The epidemiological triad includes the host, agent, and environment and describes the <emphasis effect="italics">who, what</emphasis>, and <emphasis effect="italics">where</emphasis> of the infectious process. The chain of infection builds on this triad; a disease is considered communicable or contagious (capable of spreading from one person to another) if the infected host has a portal of exit, a means of transmission, and a portal of entry into another susceptible host. Some infectious diseases can be spread by germs in the air, food, water, or soil and by vectors or by animals to humans. While these diseases are still considered infectious, as they are caused by bacteria, viruses, parasites, or fungi, they are not considered communicable from person to person.</para>
<para id="para-00004">The agent’s <term id="term-00007">pathogenicity</term> (the potential ability to cause disease in a susceptible host) depends on the agent’s infectivity and its ability to invade the host, destroy host body cells, and produce toxins that result in the virulence, or severity, of the infectious disease.</para>
<para id="para-00005">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">susceptibility</term> of a host is a key component in the epidemiological triad and chain of infection. Susceptibility depends on many factors, such as age, sex, physical health, and immune status. Portals of entry and exit can include the skin, conjunctiva, respiratory tract, GI tract, genital tract, and vertical transmission during the birthing process. The environment is a component common to both the epidemiologic triad and the chain of infection. It refers to reservoirs of infectious agents, which may be humans, animals, plants, insects, water, and soil. The environment and any environmental changes can have a significant impact on the transmission of waterborne, foodborne, and vector-borne agents. Transmission of infectious agents includes airborne, direct contact, indirect contact, and droplet transmission. If an environment is favorable for the survival of an infectious agent and there is an opportunity for the host to be exposed to the agent, infection and disease will ensue (The Alliance for Child Protection in Humanitarian Action, 2018).</para>

<section id="sect-00003">
<title>Common Communicable Diseases</title>
<para id="para-00006">As the COVID-19 pandemic showed, communicable diseases are a major global health and security threat, negatively impacting social and economic development (WHO, 2023b). Older communicable diseases such as tuberculosis (TB) remain global public health threats. Public health nursing is founded on the practice of promoting health, preventing disease and disability, and protecting the health of populations (Association of Public Health Nurses, 2022). Public health nurses require knowledge of communicable diseases and basic epidemiological principles to promote the health of individuals and communities by implementing measures to prevent and control the spread of communicable diseases.</para>
<section id="sect-00004">
<title>Influenza</title>
<para id="para-00007">Influenza viruses cause <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">influenza</term> (flu) A and B, which result in a respiratory infection affecting the nose, throat, and lungs, causing mild to severe illness and sometimes death. Influenza viruses are categorized as follows:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00002">
<item>Influenza A viruses cause the most severe and widespread disease, undergoing minor mutations (<term id="term-00010">antigenic drift</term>) each year and periodically undergoing a major mutation (<term id="term-00011">antigenic shift</term>), which results in a flu pandemic.</item>
<item>Influenza B virus often causes milder disease outbreaks, mutating gradually via antigenic drift but not undergoing antigenic shift.</item>
</list>
<para id="para-00008">Flu often occurs in the winter months but may be found year-round with testing. Each year, approximately 8 percent of the U.S. population becomes ill from flu viruses, with children twice as likely as adults over the age of 65 to develop symptomatic flu illness (CDC, 2022x). The seasonal incidence of flu changes based on the severity of the flu season. Seasonal flu is very different from pandemic flu. Seasonal flu viruses often undergo antigenic drift, necessitating an annual flu vaccine that is updated yearly to reflect current circulating influenza strains. In contrast, a major mutation resulting in a new influenza strain (antigenic shift), such as those that have occurred four times in the last 100 years, is often responsible for pandemic flu (CDC, 2022t). Hosts are more susceptible to these new disease strains as they often have little to no immunity against them (CDC, 2022t).</para>
<para id="para-00009">Flu is easily transmitted by droplets of infected material. When infected individuals talk, sneeze, or cough, infectious droplets can land in the mouths or noses of individuals nearby, spreading the disease. The flu can also be spread through indirect contact transmission (CDC, 2022x). Infected individuals are most contagious during the first three to four days of illness, but some are contagious beginning one day prior to symptom onset and up to seven days after becoming ill. Anyone can get the flu, and serious problems may occur at any age. Older adults, children under five, pregnant persons, and individuals with chronic conditions such as asthma, diabetes, and heart disease are at higher risk for developing flu-related complications. Flu symptoms include fever, chills, cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, body aches, headaches, fatigue, and sometimes vomiting and diarrhea (CDC, 2022x).</para>
</section>
<section id="sect-00005">
<title>Pneumonia</title>
<para id="para-00010">Pneumonia is a lung infection that causes mild to severe illness in individuals of all ages. Risk factors are age (older than 65, younger than five years), co-occurring chronic medical conditions, and cigarette smoking. Viruses, bacteria, and fungi are agents that can cause <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">pneumonia</term>. In the United States, the most common causes of pneumonia include:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00003">
<item>Viral: Influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and SARS-CoV-2</item>
<item>Bacterial: <emphasis effect="italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae</emphasis> (pneumococcus), <emphasis effect="italics">Mycoplasma pneumoniae</emphasis>, and <emphasis effect="italics">Chlamydophila pneumoniae</emphasis></item>
<item>Fungal: Coccidioidomycosis found in Southern California and the Southwest deserts, histoplasmosis mostly found in the Ohio and Mississippi River Valleys, and cryptococcus found in soil contaminated with bird droppings (American Lung Association [ALA], 2022)</item>
</list>
<para id="para-00011">Some types of pneumonia are contagious, spreading via droplet transmission similar to the flu. Individuals may also spread pneumonia through indirect contact transmission, and not everyone exposed to pneumonia will develop active disease (ALA, 2022). In 2021, over 40,000 individuals died from pneumonia in the United States. Many of these deaths could have been prevented or avoided with vaccines and appropriate treatments (CDC, 2022ab). Current vaccine options for bacteria and viruses that can cause pneumonia include COVID-19, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), influenza, measles, pertussis, pneumococcal (PCV), and varicella. PCV protects against 13 or 15 (PCV-13 vs. PCV-15) of the most common serotypes and is a part of the routine infant vaccination schedule, while the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) is available for individuals in high-risk groups.</para>
<para id="para-00012">Pneumonia symptoms vary greatly but may include fever, chills, a productive cough, shortness of breath, rapid or shallow breathing, sharp or stabbing chest pain, chest pain worsening with deep breathing or coughing, loss of appetite, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and confusion (ALA, 2022). In 2019, pneumonia killed 2.49 million individuals globally, one-third of whom were children under age 5 making it a leading cause of death in this population (Dadonaite &amp; Roser, 2019). Within the United States, community-acquired pneumonia is a leading cause of hospitalization and results in significant mortality (Regunath &amp; Oba, 2022).</para>

<section id="sect-00006">
<title>Hepatitis</title>
<para id="para-00013">Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver and may result from a viral infection. In the United States, its most common viral forms are hepatitis A, B, and C (<link target-id="table-00002" document="m00169"/>). Viral <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">hepatitis</term> infections affect millions of people globally, with hepatitis B and C resulting in chronic infections and liver cancer, disproportionately affecting lower-income countries. However, progress in treatment is being made globally. Hepatitis C is curable with a three-month course of medication taken once a day, and medications are available to slow the progression of hepatitis B and prevent liver damage (CDC, 2021e). Both hepatitis A and B can be prevented with safe, effective vaccines.</para>

<title>HIV/AIDS</title>
<para id="para-00014">Human immunodeficiency virus (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">HIV</term>) is a virus that attacks the body’s immune system and, if untreated, progresses to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">AIDS</term>). No current cure or vaccine exists for HIV, but with proper treatment, it can be controlled and those affected can live long, healthy lives (CDC, 2022a). In the United States, an estimated 1.2 million individuals are infected with HIV, with almost 160,000 unaware of their HIV status (CDC, 2022s). Almost 40 percent of new HIV infections are transmitted by individuals who are unaware they have the virus. Risk factors include men having sex with men (MSM); individuals who have had anal or vaginal sex with an individual who is HIV+; having multiple sex partners; sharing needles, syringes, or other drug equipment; having a history of other STIs; and concomitant hepatitis or tuberculosis (TB) (CDC, 2022ah). The CDC recommends HIV testing for everyone between the ages of 13 and 64 at least once as part of routine health care and annual testing for individuals with risk factors (CDC, 2022r, 2022s).</para>
<para id="para-00015">HIV is transmitted through direct contact with infected blood and body fluids, most often through anal or vaginal sex or sharing needles, syringes, and other drug injection equipment. HIV transmission may also occur perinatally (mother-to-child) during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding; however, this is now rare in the United States due to advances in HIV prevention and treatment (CDC, 2022a). The three stages of HIV infection include:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00004">
<item>Stage 1, acute HIV infection: Heavy HIV load in the blood, flu-like symptoms occurring 2–4 weeks after initial infection and lasting days or weeks. Individuals are very contagious during this time.</item>
<item>Stage 2, chronic HIV infection (also called asymptomatic HIV infection or clinical latency): Individuals often have no symptoms but can transmit HIV. Individuals who adhere to prescribed HIV treatment may remain at this stage and never progress to stage 3. Without treatment, this stage may last a decade or longer, or may progress faster.</item>
<item>Stage 3, AIDS: individuals have a high viral load and damaged immune systems resulting in opportunistic infections or other serious illnesses. Without HIV treatment, individuals with AIDS generally survive 3 years (CDC, 2022a).</item>
</list>
<para id="para-00016">The three available HIV tests are <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">antibody tests</term>, antigen/antibody tests, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">nucleic acid tests</term> (NAT). While these tests are accurate, no test can detect HIV immediately after infection. HIV antibodies may be undetectable to existing tests for up to 90 days after infection. Antigen/antibody tests can detect HIV 18–45 days after exposure, and NAT can detect HIV 10–33 days post exposure. NAT should be considered for people who have had a recent exposure or possible exposure with early HIV symptoms (CDC, 2022s).</para>
<para id="para-00017"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">Antiretroviral therapy</term> (ART) is an effective HIV treatment that reduces viral loads to undetectable levels, keeping the individual healthy and potentially at stage 2 (CDC, 2023g). ART is recommended for all individuals with HIV, as soon as possible after diagnosis, regardless of CD4 cell count levels, since it is associated with a large reduction in morbidity and mortality compared with those who defer treatment (CDC, 2023g). When ART therapy is taken as prescribed and in conjunction with undetectable viral loads, multiple studies have demonstrated no risk of oral, anal, or vaginal sexual HIV transmission (CDC, 2023g). ART therapy coupled with undetectable viral loads also reduces the risk of transmission during pregnancy, labor, and delivery by 99 percent (CDC, 2023g). Many individuals achieve undetectable viral loads within 6 months of beginning ART (CDC, 2023g). Treatment as prevention (TasP) helps keep individuals who are HIV positive healthy and helps them to avoid transmitting HIV to others. Some individuals with HIV refer to TasP as undetectable = untransmittable, or U=U (CDC, 2023g).</para>
<note class="health-alert" id="note-00001">
<title>HIV/AIDS</title>
<para id="para-00018">The U.S. HIV epidemic is marked by historical social injustices and disparate access to prevention, care, and treatment. The social determinants of health (SDOH) reinforce what the surveillance data demonstrate: inequities in HIV incidence, prevalence, and needs. Poverty, low education level, inequitable access to health care, and income inequality are factors related to HIV high-impact areas. Stigma, structural discrimination, and racism result in notable health disparities in individuals with HIV and AIDS. Deeper disparities are associated with intersectional identities such as being a Hispanic MSM or a Black woman living in the rural South.</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00005">
<item>Gay and bisexual men are most disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic. MSM represent 2 percent of the total U.S. population but account for 61 percent of all new U.S. HIV infections.</item>
<item>Black individuals are the most affected racial/ethnic population, representing 14 percent of the total population but accounting for 44 percent of new infections, with an infection rate almost eight times higher than White individuals.</item>
<item>Latino individuals account for 20 percent of all new HIV infections, an HIV rate three times higher than that of White individuals.</item>
<item>Individuals who inject drugs represent 9 percent of all new HIV infections.</item>
<item>Individuals who are transgender have an average prevalence rate of 28 percent among male-to-female women.</item>
<item>The southern United States has experienced the highest rates of new HIV diagnoses over the past decade, and researchers have suggested that this may be attributed to the refusal of many of these states to expand Medicaid, the lack of access to health care providers in rural areas, low health literacy levels, high rates of sexually transmitted infections, and ongoing stigma associated with HIV.</item>

<title>Tuberculosis</title>
<para id="para-00020">TB is caused by a bacterium, <emphasis effect="italics">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</emphasis> (MTB), which often attacks the lungs but can attack any part of the body. TB is spread via airborne transmission. When inhaled, TB bacteria can settle into the lungs, grow, and spread to other parts of the body (CDC, 2022u). Anyone can become infected, but certain populations, such as BIPOC individuals, individuals experiencing homelessness, and those living in congregate settings (correctional facilities, detention centers) are at higher risk of TB disease than the overall population (CDC, 2022p). Because TB infection does not always result in illness, it is often classified as latent TB infection (LTBI) vs. TB disease (<link target-id="table-00003" document="m00169"/>). Individuals infected with MTB have an estimated 5 to 10 percent lifetime risk of becoming ill with TB disease. Some will have LTBI, others will clear the infection, and some, such as those with weakened immune systems (for example, individuals living with HIV, malnutrition, or diabetes) and individuals with alcohol use disorder and tobacco dependence, will have a higher risk of becoming ill with TB disease (WHO, 2022b).

<para id="para-00023">Despite its global presence, TB is curable and preventable (WHO, 2022b). Treatment takes anywhere from four to nine months and can be expensive without adequate health insurance, creating barriers for clients who are unable or unwilling to take medication for that duration or who cannot afford the cost of treatment (CDC, 2023m; Viney et al., 2019). Treatment for active TB disease often consists of multiple drugs, some with a high side effect profile. Inadequate treatment may result in treatment failure, ongoing transmission to others, and the development of drug resistance. Drug-resistant TB, which occurs when the bacteria become resistant to the antibiotics normally used to treat it, is a public health crisis. Drug resistance is more common in individuals who do not take their TB drugs regularly, in those who develop TB re-infection after being treated for TB in the past, and in individuals from areas of the world where drug-resistant TB is common (CDC, 2022i).</para>

<title>Noroviruses</title>
<para id="para-00027">The highly contagious <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00026">norovirus</term> is the leading cause of vomiting and diarrhea from acute gastroenteritis in the United States across all age groups (CDC, 2023l). Each year, there are between 19 million and 21 million cases, with over 100,000 hospitalizations and approximately 900 deaths; these cases occur more commonly between November and April (CDC, 2021c; CDC, 2023l). Older adults and children under 5 are most likely to have complications related to norovirus. By age 5, one in 110,000 children will die from norovirus and one in 160 will be hospitalized (CDC, 2023k). Though they are often referred to as a “stomach bug” or “stomach flu,” none are related to influenza viruses (CDC, 2023l).</para>
<para id="para-00028">Norovirus is transmitted via the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00027">fecal-oral route</term> through contaminated hands, food, or water or by contact with contaminated surfaces. The most common symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach pain that often resolves within 48 hours (CDC, 2023l).</para>
<para id="para-00029">Common settings for norovirus outbreaks include hospitals, long-term care facilities, restaurants, schools, childcare centers, colleges, and cruise ships. Foods commonly implicated are leafy green vegetables, fresh fruits, and shellfish (CDC, 2021c).</para>

<title>Non-typhoidal Salmonella</title>
<para id="para-00031">Salmonella bacteria are classified as “typhoidal” or “non-typhoidal.” Typhoidal <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">salmonella</term> serotypes cause typhoid fever. This discussion focuses on non-typhoidal salmonella, which causes an estimated 1.35 million illnesses and 420 deaths annually in the United States (CDC, 2022ae). For every confirmed positive lab test, an estimated 30 cases go unreported (CDC, 2022ad). Children under age 5 are more likely to become infected; this age group, adults over 65, and individuals who are immunocompromised are most likely to have severe infections (CDC, 2022ae).</para>
<para id="para-00032">Salmonella bacteria live in the intestinal tracts of humans, amphibians, reptiles, poultry, and other birds and in the feces of some animals (CDC, 2022ae) and infect individuals who do not wash their hands after contact with animals or animal feces. Salmonella can also be found in foods like chicken, turkey, beef, pork, eggs, fruits, and vegetables. Salmonellas contaminate an estimated one out of every 25 packages of supermarket chicken, infecting individuals if the contaminated chicken is not cooked thoroughly or if its juices leak onto surfaces or foods that are not cooked such as fruit and produce (CDC, 2022ad).</para>
<para id="para-00033">Salmonella illness, salmonellosis, results in a mild to severe diarrheal illness, acute gastroenteritis. Symptoms include sudden onset of diarrhea that may or may not be bloody, abdominal cramping, and fever. Less commonly, nausea, vomiting, and headache may be present. Diarrhea may last for days, increasing the risk of severe dehydration, especially in infants, young children, and older adults. Most individuals recover within seven days without antibiotic treatment; however, it can take months before bowel habits return to normal. Occasionally, salmonella infection can spread to other body areas, referred to as extra-intestinal infections, and it may be severe enough to cause disability and death (CDC, 2022ae).</para>

<title>Listeria Monocytogenes</title>
<para id="para-00035">The bacteria <emphasis effect="italics"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029">Listeria monocytogenes</term></emphasis> causes listeriosis, a serious but rare infection. In the United States, an estimated 1,600 individuals become ill with listeriosis each year, and 260 individuals die from it (CDC, 2023i). Listeriosis most often infects and sickens pregnant individuals, their newborns, adults over 65, and individuals with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is usually a mild illness in pregnant individuals, but it may cause severe disease in the fetus or newborn. Sometimes listeriosis becomes invasive—causing sepsis, meningitis, or encephalitis—and affects other parts of the body (CDC, 2023i).</para>
<para id="para-00036"><emphasis effect="italics">Listeria</emphasis> bacteria are difficult to remove from food processing facilities, where they will spread to food that touches contaminated surfaces (CDC, 2023i). Refrigeration does not kill <emphasis effect="italics">Listeria</emphasis>, but the bacteria is easily killed by heating food to a high enough temperature (CDC, 2023i). Foods more likely to be contaminated with <emphasis effect="italics">Listeria</emphasis> include soft cheeses; deli products such as sliced cold cuts or cheese; deli salads such as coleslaw, potato salad, tuna salad, and chicken salad; sprouts; unpasteurized milk and associated products; hot dogs; and fermented or dry sausages such as chorizo, pepperoni, and salami (CDC, 2023i).</para>
<para id="para-00037">Listeriosis often results in fever and diarrhea, similar to other foodborne illnesses, but it is rarely diagnosed. More often, it is only identified if it becomes invasive or occurs during pregnancy. Signs of invasive listeriosis are meningitis-like symptoms of headache, nuchal rigidity, fever, confusion, and convulsions. Invasive listeriosis is serious, requiring inpatient hospital care; it causes death in one in five infected individuals (CDC, 2023i). Pregnant clients often experience fever and flu-like symptoms; however, listeriosis can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery, or life-threatening infections of the newborn. Listeriosis during pregnancy results in a fetal loss in 20 percent of the cases and results in newborn death in about 3 percent of the cases (CDC, 2023i).</para>

<section id="sect-00014">
<title>Escherichia Coli</title>
<para id="para-00038"><emphasis effect="italics">Escherichia coli</emphasis> (<emphasis effect="italics"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00030">E. coli</term></emphasis>) bacteria are normally found in human and animal intestines. While most are harmless, some may cause diarrhea, respiratory illness, and urinary tract or bloodstream infections ranging in severity (CDC, 2022k). Older adults, children under age 5, those with weakened immune systems, pregnant individuals, and individuals who travel to certain countries are at higher risk for infection, although it can affect anyone (CDC, 2022k). The six types of pathogenic <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis> strains that cause diarrhea are often called diarrheagenic <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis>. Of this group, Shiga toxin-producing <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis> 0157 (STEC) is most commonly associated with foodborne outbreaks. An estimated 265,000 STEC infections occur in the United States each year; however, the actual number is likely higher as many infected individuals do not seek medical care and, if they do, may not have their stool tested (CDC, 2022j).</para>
<para id="para-00039">STEC is transmitted through ingestion of tiny amounts of human or animal feces, such as through contaminated food, unpasteurized milk, untreated water, or contact with cattle or with the feces of infected individuals. The CDC recommends avoiding unpasteurized milk, unpasteurized apple cider, and soft cheeses made from raw milk as these carry a high risk of STEC infection. Individuals have contracted infections by swallowing lake water while swimming, touching the environment in petting zoos, not washing hands after changing diapers, and eating food prepared by people who did not follow hand hygiene after using the restroom. In the United States in 2021 and 2022, there were a total of seven STEC outbreaks. These outbreaks were associated with prepared food items such as packaged salads, baby spinach, cake mix, frozen falafel, ground beef, and other unknown food sources (CDC, 2022j).</para>
<para id="para-00040">STEC infections often cause diarrhea (which may or may not be bloody), stomach cramps, vomiting, and low-grade fever. Symptoms usually last five to seven days with illness severity ranging from mild to life-threatening. Typically, individuals will begin to feel ill three to four days after ingesting STEC. Between 5 and 10 percent of individuals will develop hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a condition that can lead to kidney failure, about a week after symptoms first appear when the diarrhea is improving (CDC, 2022k).</para>

<title>Vector-Borne Diseases</title>
<para id="para-00046">Vector-borne diseases are illnesses caused by infections transmitted by <term id="term-00034">vectors</term>, living organisms such as ticks and mosquitos that feed on human or animal blood (WHO, 2020). When vectors ingest infectious pathogens via blood from an infected host, they can transmit the pathogens to a new host. Once infectious, vectors can often transmit the disease for the remainder of their lives during each subsequent bite of a new host (WHO, 2020). Globally, vector-borne diseases are responsible for over 17 percent of all infectious diseases, causing more than 700,000 annual deaths (WHO, 2020). Global travel and urbanization have contributed to increasing vector-borne diseases, making everyone susceptible to diseases spread by mosquitos and ticks (CDC, 2019i, 2020b). In the United States, vector-borne diseases more than doubled from 2004 to 2018. The CDC reported nearly 650,000 cases between 2004 and 2016, with a high likelihood that the actual number was significantly higher due to underreporting.</para>
<section id="sect-00017">
<title>Lyme Disease</title>
<para id="para-00047"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00035">Lyme disease</term> is the most commonly reported vector-borne illness in the United States, with approximately 300,000 annual infections (CDC, 2019i). It is most often found in the Upper Midwest, Northeast, and Mid-Atlantic, where it is spread by the Ixodes scapularis tick. The Ixodes pacificus tick is implicated in cases in northern California, Oregon, and Washington (CDC, 2022y). The geographic range of the ticks that spread Lyme disease is expanding, due in part to a changing landscape and climate (Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, n.d.).</para>
<para id="para-00048">Symptoms of early localized disease, within a month after the tick bite, include fever, chills, fatigue, headache, myalgias, arthralgia, lymphadenopathy, and <term id="term-00036">erythema migrans (EM)</term>, a red, ring-shaped rash at the bite site that expands over several days, often to sizes greater than five centimeters in diameter with a central clearing that results in a “bull’s eye” appearance, although the rash can appear different on darker skin tones (<link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00169"/>, <link target-id="fig-00002" document="m00169"/>). EM occurs in up to 80 percent of those infected with Lyme, but the classic rash is not always present (CDC, 2022y). Untreated or undiagnosed early Lyme progresses to disseminated disease in about 60 percent of clients, with symptoms appearing months after the tick bite. Disseminated disease may present with skin, neurologic, cardiac, or rheumatologic manifestations. Performing serologic testing for Lyme disease is recommended when disseminated Lyme disease is being considered. However, clinical diagnosis is recommended over serologic testing for clients who present with an EM rash after frequenting an area where Lyme is common (CDC, 2022y).</para>
<para id="para-00049">In a study by Ly (2021), the researcher found that Black clients with Lyme disease seem to be diagnosed later in the disease process than White clients. Black clients are more often diagnosed with disseminated disease upon initial diagnosis and appear to be diagnosed outside of the months that Lyme disease is most frequently diagnosed, reinforcing the idea that they are diagnosed later in the disease process. A study by Palmiere et al. (2019) looked into missed and delayed Lyme diagnoses in dark-skinned populations of Appalachia with findings that echo the work by Ly. A potential reason for these missed or delayed diagnoses may be related to the varying appearance of EM in individuals with dark skin (Minority Nurse, 2013). The EM is an early sign of Lyme disease, whereas late symptoms include arthritis and neurological symptoms. Ly (2021) found that 34 percent of Black clients were diagnosed with neurological symptoms in comparison to only 9 percent of White clients, reinforcing the earlier diagnosis in White clients (Eldred, 2022; Ly, 2019). Another study showed similar findings among Black children—that they were less likely to be diagnosed with Lyme disease and were more likely to be diagnosed with the arthritis manifestations related to Lyme disease and not the skin or cutaneous manifestations (Hunt et al., 2023). It is imperative that nurses remain aware of the risks of Lyme disease in all clients and educate clients who are darker skinned on the signs and symptoms of Lyme disease to be aware of. Early diagnosis of Lyme disease and proper treatment with antibiotics usually results in a rapid and complete recovery (CDC, 2022y). Education on tick bite prevention and tick removal can help prevent spread of the disease.</para>

<title>West Nile Virus</title>
<para id="para-00050">Spread by the bite of an infected mosquito, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00037">West Nile virus</term> (WNV) is the leading cause of mosquito-borne disease in the United States. The disease is now considered native to the United States, with outbreaks reported each summer through the fall (CDC, 2019i). Mosquitos become infected with WNV by feeding on infected birds and then spread it to people and animals by biting them. In rare cases, WNV has been spread through blood transfusion, organ transplant, and perinatal transmission from mother to baby during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. It is not spread through droplets, by touching live animals or birds, or by eating infected animals (CDC, 2022am).</para>
<para id="para-00051">Although most infected individuals have no symptoms, one in five experiences fever, headache, body aches, vomiting, and diarrhea. Serious, sometimes fatal, disease occurs in one out 150 infected individuals, and of this group, one out of 10 die (CDC, 2022am). This severe infection often affects the central nervous system (neuroinvasive disease), causing encephalitis, acute flaccid paralysis, or meningitis. Recovery can take several months, and some effects may be permanent (CDC, 2022am).</para>
<para id="para-00052">WNV should be considered in any client with a febrile or acute neurologic illness with a recent exposure to mosquitos, blood transfusion, or organ transplant (CDC, 2023c). Lab diagnosis can be accomplished by testing the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and detecting WNV-specific IgM antibodies. Viral cultures and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction tests can be performed on blood specimens and confirm infection (CDC, 2023c). This is a <term id="term-00038">nationally notifiable condition</term>, a disease that, by law, must be reported to government authorities, allowing for case surveillance to assess transmission patterns and determine interventions to control outbreaks. Local and federal laws and regulations determine which diseases and conditions must be reported for case surveillance (CDC, 2022v). This will be discussed in more detail in the next section, 13.3 <link document="m00170">Infectious Disease Prevention and Control</link>.</para>

<section id="sect-00019">
<title>Zika Virus</title>
<para id="para-00053">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00039">Zika virus</term> is caused by infected <emphasis effect="italics">Aedes aegypti</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">Aedes albopictus</emphasis> mosquitoes found throughout the United States (CDC, 2019i). It can be passed from a pregnant person to their fetus, and fetal infection during pregnancy may cause birth defects such as microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects (CDC, 2022aq). Zika can also be passed from an infected person via sexual activity including vaginal, anal, and oral sex and sharing sex toys, but male and female condoms can reduce this risk. Sexual transmission is especially concerning as many individuals infected with Zika are asymptomatic and may be unaware they are infected. Blood or urine tests can confirm infection. In 2015–2016, a large outbreak of travel-associated Zika cases occurred in the United States, along with local transmission cases of Zika in Florida and Texas. In 2017, the number of Zika cases in the United States started to decline, and no cases of Zika transmission by mosquitos have been reported since 2018; however, Zika remains a global health threat (CDC, 2022aq).</para>
<para id="para-00054">Clinical findings in symptomatic disease include acute onset of fever with maculopapular rash, arthralgia, or conjunctivitis (CDC, 2019m). Other symptoms may include myalgias and headaches with clinical illness lasting a week or less. Zika infection during pregnancy causes severe fetal brain defects, including <term id="term-00040">microcephaly</term>, a condition where a baby’s head is much smaller than expected, often resulting in abnormal brain development. Infants born to individuals with Zika infection during pregnancy must be evaluated for congenital infection and neurologic abnormalities (CDC, 2019m). Zika is a nationally notifiable condition reported to state and local health departments. No specific treatment for Zika exists as it is supportive in nature including rest, fluids, and use of analgesics or antipyretics. Those who are infected should be protected from further mosquito exposure for a few days after illness to prevent transmission to other mosquitos, thereby reducing the risk of local transmission (CDC, 2022aq).</para>

<title>Malaria</title>
<para id="para-00055">A mosquito-borne disease, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00041">malaria</term> is caused by a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00042">parasite</term> (<emphasis effect="italics">Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae,</emphasis> and<emphasis effect="italics"> P. knowlesi</emphasis>) that frequently infects the Anopheles mosquito and is then transmitted to humans through this infected mosquito’s bite (CDC, 2022z). It can also be transmitted through a blood transfusion, through an organ transplant, perinatally, or by sharing needles contaminated with blood. Malaria can result in serious illness and death (CDC, 2022z). <emphasis effect="italics">P. falciparum</emphasis> causes the most severe malaria and is common in many African countries. Individuals living in poverty or rural areas lacking access to health care are at the greatest risk for life-threatening illness (CDC, 2022z). An estimated 241 million malaria cases occurred globally in 2020, with over 600,000 deaths. An estimated 90 percent of these deaths occurred in children under age 5 in sub-Saharan Africa, where the disease perpetuates a cycle of disease and poverty (CDC, 2022z). Almost half of the world’s population is at risk for malaria, and lower-income countries are disproportionately affected (WHO, 2023a). Within the United States, approximately 2,000 cases are diagnosed yearly, with most cases occurring in immigrants and travelers returning from countries where malaria is endemic, such as sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia (CDC, 2022z).</para>
<para id="para-00056">Clinical findings in acute malaria include flu-like symptoms of fever, chills, headache, myalgias, fatigue, GI symptoms, and sometimes anemia and jaundice. Untreated malaria may cause kidney failure, seizures, mental status changes, coma, and death. <emphasis effect="italics">P. vivax</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">P. ovale</emphasis> may result in relapsing malaria because these parasites can remain dormant in the liver and then come out of hibernation, resulting in acute illness (CDC, 2022z). Available malaria treatments are highly effective when started at the onset of symptoms (CDC, 2022z). Malaria is a nationally notifiable condition that must be reported to state health departments and the CDC through the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00043">National Malaria Surveillance System</term> (NMSS). The CDC investigates locally transmitted malaria, such as transfusion malaria, and supports health professionals in preventing, diagnosing, and treating malaria (CDC, 2020a). In June 2023, the CDC issued a health alert advisory notifying clinicians, public health authorities, and the general public about the identification of a handful of cases of locally acquired <emphasis effect="italics">P. vivax</emphasis> malaria in Florida and one in Texas (CDC, 2023j). This was the first time in 20 years that a case of locally acquired malaria was identified in the United States. Although the risk of locally acquired malaria remains low, vigilance is needed to prevent mosquito bites (CDC, 2023j).</para>

<title>Sexually Transmitted Infections</title>
<para id="para-00068"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00056">Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)</term>, also called <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00057">sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)</term>, are infections that transmit from person to person through vaginal, oral, and anal sex and less commonly through intimate physical contact (CDC, 2022f). An estimated one in five individuals in the United States are affected by STIs, with 26 million new STI cases in 2018 (CDC, 2022af). STIs are preventable, and many are easily treatable if diagnosed promptly. Some STIs do not cause obvious symptoms, while others only cause mild symptoms; therefore, screening is extremely important for sexually active individuals. Untreated STIs are associated with increased risk of HIV, chronic pelvic pain, and reproductive issues associated with pregnancy. In the United States, those most affected by STIs are people ages 15 to 24, gay and bisexual men, pregnant individuals, and racial and ethnic minority groups (CDC, 2022af). The eight most common STIs are chlamydia, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, herpes simplex virus type 2, HIV, human papillomavirus, syphilis, and trichomoniasis (CDC, 2022af).</para>
<section id="sect-00027">
<title>Chlamydia</title>
<para id="para-00069">Caused by infection with <emphasis effect="italics">Chlamydia trachomatis</emphasis>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00058">chlamydia</term> is the most frequently reported bacterial STI, resulting in cervicitis, urethritis, and proctitis. In 2018, there were an estimated 4 million chlamydia infections in the United States (CDC, 2022c). Many individuals are asymptomatic and do not seek testing. Screening is necessary to identify most infections and can reduce the rates of adverse outcomes in women. In women, untreated infections can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), tubal infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain (CDC, 2022c). In men, untreated infections rarely result in major health problems but may cause infertility. Chlamydial infections are most common in young people ages 15 to 24 and BIPOC individuals. In 2020, chlamydia rates for Black individuals were six times the rate seen in White individuals (CDC, 2022c).</para>
<para id="para-00070">Chlamydia is transmitted via vaginal, anal, or oral sex with an infected partner. Ejaculation is not necessary to transmit the infection. It can infect the pharynx, cervix, urethra, upper reproductive tract, rectum, and conjunctiva. Symptoms in women may include abnormal vaginal discharge and dysuria. Symptoms may include penile discharge, dysuria, and pain and swelling in one or both testicles in men. Symptoms of rectal chlamydia may include rectal pain, discharge, and bleeding. Pregnant individuals can pass chlamydia to their baby during childbirth, resulting in pre-term delivery, conjunctivitis, and pneumonia in the neonate (CDC, 2022c).</para>
<para id="para-00071">When used correctly and with each sexual encounter, condoms can reduce the risk of chlamydia. Avoiding oral, vaginal, and anal sex is the only way to prevent chlamydia. Being in a mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who does not have chlamydia also lowers one’s risk (CDC, 2022c).</para>
</section>
<section id="sect-00028">
<title>Gonorrhea</title>
<para id="para-00072">Caused by <emphasis effect="italics">Neisseria gonorrhoeae</emphasis>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00059">gonorrhea</term> is the second most commonly reported bacterial STI. Approximately 1.6 new infections occurred in the United States in 2018, with more than half among individuals ages 15 to 24. Because many infections are asymptomatic, the true number of cases may be much higher than reported (CDC, 2022o). Any sexually active individual can become infected, but most cases are among teenagers, young adults, and Black individuals (CDC, 2022o).</para>
<para id="para-00073">Gonorrhea is transmitted via sexual contact with the penis, vagina, mouth, or anus of an infected partner. Ejaculation is not needed for transmission. It infects the mucous membranes of the reproductive tract in women and of the mouth, throat, eyes, and rectum of both men and women (CDC, 2022o). Gonorrhea can also be spread during childbirth. Infection in newborns may result in blindness, joint infection, or sepsis; treatment of gonorrhea in pregnant individuals reduces the risk of these complications.</para>
<para id="para-00074">Symptoms in women are often mild, nonspecific, and mistaken for bladder or vaginal infections. Initial symptoms include dysuria, increased vaginal discharge, and bleeding between menses. Symptoms in men occur one to 14 days after infection and include dysuria; white, yellow, or green urethral discharge; and potential testicular or scrotal pain indicative of concomitant epididymitis, a complication of urethral infection (CDC, 2022o). Rectal infection may also be asymptomatic or cause discharge, anal itching, pain, bleeding, or painful bowel movements. Pharyngeal infection may result in a sore throat or may be asymptomatic (CDC, 2022o). Complications of gonorrhea include PID in women, which may lead to chronic pelvic pain, infertility, or increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. In men, complications include epididymitis and infertility. Untreated gonorrhea can potentially spread to the blood, resulting in disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI), a life-threatening infection characterized by arthritis, tenosynovitis, and dermatitis (CDC, 2022o).</para>
<para id="para-00075">When used correctly and with every sexual encounter, latex condoms reduce the risk of gonorrhea. Avoiding oral, vaginal, and anal sex is the surest way to prevent gonorrhea. Being in a long-term, mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who does not have gonorrhea is another way to lower one’s risk (CDC, 2022o).</para>

<para id="para-00076">Healthy People 2030 has a focused goal of reducing sexually transmitted infections and improving access to quality STI care. Data demonstrates worsening rates for three of the 22 objectives that apply to this goal: reducing syphilis rates in females, reducing gonorrhea rates in male adolescents and young men, and reducing congenital syphilis rates. These worsening rates have led to a push to increase screening for these diseases and to provide updated STI treatment guidelines for providers.</para>

<title>Syphilis</title>
<para id="para-00077">Rates of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00060">syphilis</term>, a bacterial STI caused by <emphasis effect="italics">Treponema pallidum</emphasis>, have steadily risen over the past 20 years. In 2021, the United States reported 176,713 cases, an approximately 73 percent increase over a four-year period (CDC, 2022ak). MSM accounted for 43 percent of all primary and secondary cases, but cases are increasing among heterosexual individuals. Congenital syphilis, another growing concern, occurs when a pregnant person passes syphilis to the fetus. Over 2,800 cases of congenital syphilis were reported in 2021, a 185 percent increase since 2017 (CDC, 2022ak).</para>
<para id="para-00078">Syphilis spreads through direct contact with a syphilitic chancre (sore) that is usually located on or around the penis, vagina, anus, rectum, lips, or mouth (CDC, 2022ak). It is also transmitted during vaginal, anal, or oral sex and pregnancy. When a pregnant client has syphilis, the infection can spread to the fetus, resulting in a high risk of stillbirth or death shortly after birth. Untreated syphilis in pregnant clients results in infant death in up to 40 percent of cases (CDC, 2022ak). A newborn with congenital syphilis may be asymptomatic, but without immediate treatment, serious problems such as developmental delays, seizures, and death may ensue (CDC, 2022ak).</para>
<para id="para-00079">Often beginning three weeks after initial infection, symptoms may resemble those of many other diseases, yet they follow a typical progression, with each stage potentially lasting for weeks, months, or years. At any stage of infection, syphilis can invade the nervous system (neurosyphilis), the visual system (ocular syphilis), and the auditory and vestibular systems (otosyphlis). The four stages are as follows:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00047">
<item>The primary stage starts with a single or multiple firm, round, painless chancres located where syphilis entered the body that last three to six weeks and then heal, regardless of treatment. Without treatment, syphilis will progress to the secondary stage (CDC, 2022ak).</item>
<item>In the secondary stage, lesions develop in the mouth, vagina, or anus, and skin rashes that are not usually itchy and may appear as rough red or reddish-brown spots appear on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. They can be very faint, making them difficult to see. Condyloma lata—large, raised gray or white lesions—may develop in moist, warm areas such as the mouth, axilla, and groin. Other symptoms are fever, swollen lymph nodes, sore throat, headaches, weight loss, myalgias, fatigue, and patchy hair loss. These symptoms will resolve with or without treatment, but an untreated infection will progress to the latent and potentially tertiary stage of disease (CDC, 2022ak).</item>
<item>In the latent stage, there are no visible symptoms, and without treatment, it will remain in the body. This stage can last for years.</item>
<item>Tertiary syphilis may develop in some untreated syphilis infections, appearing 10 to 30 years after initial infection and affecting multiple organ systems. This stage is rare, but it can be fatal.</item>
</list>
<para id="para-00080">Condoms, when used correctly, can reduce the risk of syphilis; however, transmission can occur if the condom does not cover the lesions. Avoiding oral, vaginal, and anal sex is the only way to avoid syphilis. Being in a mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who does not have syphilis is another way to lower one’s risk of getting syphilis (CDC, 2022ak).</para>

<title>Vaccine-Preventable Diseases (VPDs)</title>
<para id="para-00084">The introduction of vaccines is a significant public health victory as many notifiable infectious diseases, such as diphtheria, measles, polio, tetanus, and rubella, have nearly been eliminated in the United States (CDC, 2022q). By the time a child reaches age 2, they can be vaccinated against 14 potentially life-threatening illnesses if the vaccine guidelines have been followed (CDC, 2022q). In adolescence, additional vaccines are available to prevent pertussis, meningococcal disease, and human papillomavirus. Since 2020, COVID-19 has remained in the top 10 leading causes of death, in the number three spot behind heart disease and cancer (CDC, 2023h). This illustrates the importance of monitoring for communicable disease and the role of public health in keeping individuals and communities safe.</para>
<para id="para-00085">The CDC (2022g) recommends vaccines to prevent the following <link url="https://openstax.org/r/globalhealth">vaccine-preventable diseases</link> (VPDs):</para>

<para id="para-00086">While vaccines are considered the best way to prevent diseases and outbreaks, not everyone gets vaccinated. Only 70 percent of children born in the United States in 2016 received their recommended vaccines by age 2 (CDC, 2022q). Non-Hispanic Black children were less likely to receive their early childhood vaccine series than non-Hispanic White children (CDC, 2022q). As fewer children are vaccinated, the United States has seen the reemergence of VPD outbreaks. Unvaccinated children risk becoming infected and transmitting these infectious diseases to others, including to individuals who are too young or too immunocompromised to be vaccinated.</para>

<para id="para-00087">Globally, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00066">measles</term> remains a highly contagious disease, and each year, unvaccinated Americans contract it while traveling abroad and then spread it to other individuals who are unvaccinated (Vaccinate Your Family [VYF], 2022). Measles outbreaks have occurred more frequently in the United States over the past decade, often in communities with groups of unvaccinated individuals. In 2019, the CDC reported almost 1,300 cases of measles in 31 states, and of these individuals, 10 percent were hospitalized (VYF, 2022). This is concerning, especially for children under age 1 who are unable to be vaccinated. Prior to the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine, three to 4 million individuals in the United States contracted measles, and about 500 died (VYF, 2022).</para>

<para id="para-00089">An endemic disease in the United States, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00067">whooping cough</term> (pertussis) is transmitted easily from person to person, with outbreaks occurring in schools, childcare centers, hospitals, and even in large geographic areas (CDC, 2022ao). Like any endemic disease, whooping cough may cause an outbreak, during which public health officials focus on protecting those at higher risk of getting sick and dying. Outbreaks are often difficult to identify; many cases go unreported because a variety of other illnesses cause similar symptoms. Whooping cough is a nationally notifiable disease with local and state health departments taking the lead on investigations. During an outbreak, public health nurses may be involved in active screening at schools, hospitals, and childcare centers to reduce exposure to individuals with pertussis, recommend timely medical evaluation, and promote prompt use of antibiotics to high-risk close contacts.</para>
<para id="para-00090">In the United States, up to 20 babies die each year due to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00068">pertussis</term> (VYF, 2022). To decrease the risk in young babies, the CDC recommends women receive Tdap vaccination during each pregnancy, preferably between the 27th and 36th weeks (CDC, 2022ao). Before routine vaccination, pertussis was one of the most common childhood diseases and a major cause of death in children. While the vaccine has decreased its incidence, immunity diminishes, highlighting the importance of receiving recommended vaccinations at the recommended times.</para>
<para id="para-00091">Nurses play a critical role in educating individuals and communities about the importance of adhering to the recommended vaccination schedule. This includes being fully informed of the vaccine schedule, indications, contraindications, and types of available vaccines. The CDC has published <link url="https://openstax.org/r/vaccines">You Call the Shots</link>, an interactive, web-based immunization training course for nurses and other health care professionals discussing VPDs and current recommendations for vaccine use. Holding immunization clinics, visiting clients in their homes, providing pre–school entry immunization reviews, and offering accessible and convenient community information sessions are pivotal to gaining acceptance by vaccine-hesitant individuals. Nurses should follow the guidelines on nationally notifiable diseases and prepare accordingly by ordering the appropriate vaccines and necessary supplies to administer them.</para>

<title>Emerging Infectious Diseases</title>
<para id="para-00092"><term id="term-00069">Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs)</term> are those that are newly affecting populations or existing diseases that previously only caused isolated disease but are now significantly increasing in incidence and geographic range (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [NIAID], 2018; Wang et al., 2021). Bioterrorism Category A, B, and C priority pathogens are also considered EIDs (<link target-id="table-00010" document="m00169"/>) (NIAID, 2018). Because these diseases are new or were once less common, there are often minimal effective treatments and no cures. Without the benefit of prior knowledge and a lack of immunity, health care providers often contract EIDs as they tend to ill clients (WHO, 2014). Many EIDs are zoonotic in origin, emerging from animals and crossing the species barrier to infect humans (WHO, 2014). EIDs remain a global health threat as they can spread rapidly, posing a risk to the health and development of every country. As the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated, infectious diseases can cause significant death and disability and wreak havoc on the world economy, disrupting every level of society. <link target-id="table-00011" document="m00169"/> lists some emerging infectious diseases (Wang et al., 2021).</para>

<para id="para-00093">Pathogenic microorganisms cause infectious diseases that spread by direct or indirect transmission. A disease is communicable if the infected host has a portal of exit, a means of transmission, and a portal of entry into another susceptible host. If an environment is favorable for the infectious agent’s survival and opportunity exists for the host’s exposure to it, infection and disease will ensue. Some infectious disease outbreaks result from direct contact with an infected individual’s respiratory secretions, while others are transmitted through blood or bodily fluids. Still others result from an intermediary, such as vectors, water, or food. Breaking the chain of transmission is key to control and prevention of these illnesses and outbreaks.</para>
