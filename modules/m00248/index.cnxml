<title>Tubercular Infections</title>
<para id="para-00002"><term id="term-00001">Tuberculosis (TB)</term> is a deadly respiratory infection primarily caused by the organism <emphasis effect="italics">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</emphasis>. Worldwide, TB is the second leading cause of infectious deaths after COVID-19 (World Health Organization, 2023a). Although TB is less of a concern in high-income nations, it is still a major cause for concern in lower-income nations and in clients at greater risk, including those who are immunocompromised and those living in close contact with other people (e.g., prisons, shelters, nursing homes). TB has been found to disproportionately affect marginalized racial and ethnic groups who already have limited access to health care and are most susceptible to the devastating effects of TB (CDC, 2018).</para>
<para id="para-00003"><emphasis effect="italics">M. tuberculosis</emphasis> is a slow-growing mycobacterium that possesses a cellular envelope made up of mycolic acid, which makes it difficult for conventional antibiotics to penetrate and inhibit cellular growth. After an individual inhales aerosol droplets containing <emphasis effect="italics">M. tuberculosis</emphasis>, they may either clear the organism immediately, develop an active TB infection, or develop latent TB, in which the organism goes into a dormant state. Latent TB can reside in the person’s lungs for years, waiting to activate either spontaneously or through an episode of immunosuppression that can be brought on by conditions such as HIV, diabetes, end-stage kidney disease, or the use of corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone, prednisone).</para>
<para id="para-00004">Individuals with TB typically present with common signs and symptoms, including weight loss, fatigue, productive cough, fever, and night sweats. Other signs and symptoms may include chest pain and hemoptysis (coughing up of blood). The health care provider should order a chest x-ray and then sputum samples if the x-ray shows infiltrates suggestive of TB. Common findings on chest x-ray in clients with TB include mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pleural effusion, and pulmonary consolidation. Cases of latent TB are often screened for using tuberculin skin tests or interferon gamma release assay. Skin testing introduces tuberculin protein under the skin; redness and swelling (induration) at the injection site due to the presence of TB antibodies indicates latent TB infection. If clients show positive results from these tests, they will be referred for more diagnostic testing, including a chest x-ray to determine whether a latent infection is present.</para>
</section>
<section id="sect-00004">
<title>First-Line Drug Therapy</title>
<para id="para-00005">Once a definitive diagnosis of TB has been made, treatment specific for TB should begin immediately. Due to the difficulty of drug penetration and the slow-growing nature of the organism, TB treatment requires at least 6 months of therapy. Failure to adhere to TB therapy can lead to clinical worsening in the client and more resistant strains of <emphasis effect="italics">M. tuberculosis.</emphasis> Traditionally, clients with an active TB infection begin therapy with a four-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for 2 months followed by 4 additional months of isoniazid and rifampin. The specific drugs used and their durations may be altered depending on client comorbidities and TB resistance.</para>
<note class="clinical-tip" id="note-00001">
<title>Antitubercular Drug Compliance</title>
<para id="para-00007">Adherence to antitubercular drug regimens is critical to ensure eradication of the infection and prevention of drug-resistant strains of TB. One way to help ensure adherence is by using directly observed therapy, in which a trained observer watches the client take every dose of their TB medication. This can take place in the clinic, home care agency, correctional facility, or treatment center. Directly observed therapy helps provide stability and accountability and has been shown to increase antitubercular drug therapy completion. Directly observed therapy can even be completed electronically if that is more convenient for the client (Burzynski et al., 2022).</para>
</note>
<para id="para-00008">Drugs used to treat TB include:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00002">
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Ethambutol hydrochloride:</emphasis> Ethambutol inhibits RNA synthesis in susceptible mycobacteria to suppress cellular replication.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Isoniazid:</emphasis> Isoniazid is an important component of the antitubercular regimen and works by inhibiting the production of mycolic acid. This inhibition disrupts the integrity of the mycobacterial cell wall, causing cell death.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Pyrazinamide:</emphasis> Pyrazinamide is used during the first 2 months of therapy. Its mechanism for inhibiting <emphasis effect="italics">M. tuberculosis</emphasis> is not fully known, but it is thought to reduce the pH of the local environment and discourage mycobacterial growth.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Rifamycins:</emphasis> Rifampin, rifabutin, and rifapentine belong to the rifamycin class. These medications work to inhibit mycobacterial growth by binding to the enzyme RNA polymerase to reduce the cell’s ability to produce new proteins, thereby stifling growth.</item>

<section id="sect-00005">
<title>Drug Therapy for Multidrug-Resistant Tubercular Infections</title>
<para id="para-00009">Growing resistance to standard therapy is an ongoing concern for health care professionals managing TB. Health care providers should take care to select agents that the mycobacterium is susceptible to and weigh that efficacy against the adverse effect profiles of these agents. Selection should be based on sensitivity testing performed on samples collected from the client at the time of diagnosis and is made based on the discretion of an expert in infectious disease. Alternative agents include aminosalicylate sodium, capreomycin, ethionamide, and streptomycin. Resistant cases of TB should be referred to infectious disease specialists to ensure appropriate management of these complex cases.</para>

<section id="sect-00006">
<title>Adverse Effects and Contraindications</title>
<para id="para-00012">Antituberculosis medications are known to cause gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. A contraindication to any antituberculosis drug is known hypersensitivity.</para>
<para id="para-00013">Ethambutol is partially renally eliminated, so the dose should be adjusted in clients with renal dysfunction. The major adverse effects seen with ethambutol are optic nerve inflammation, changes in visual acuity, and loss of ability to distinguish between the colors red and green.</para>
<para id="para-00014">Isoniazid is a known hepatotoxin; serial liver function tests should be performed to determine whether therapy should be altered. Isoniazid also can cause neurotoxicity, including peripheral neuropathies at standard doses and seizures and coma in overdose. Clients particularly at risk for neurotoxicity include those who are pyridoxine deficient (e.g., pregnant clients, individuals with excessive alcohol intake).</para>
<note class="safety-alert" id="note-00002">
<title>Isoniazid</title>
<para id="para-00015">Nurses must inform clients that they should have their liver function assessed regularly while on isoniazid to monitor for liver toxicity. The client should also abstain from excessive alcohol use, which may increase the risk for hepatotoxicity. Excessive drinking includes binge drinking (4 or more drinks during a single occasion for females or 5 or more drinks during a single occasion for males) and heavy drinking (8 or more drinks per week for females or 15 or more drinks per week for males).</para>
</note>
<para id="para-00016">Pyrazinamide also is a known hepatotoxin, so serial liver function tests should be monitored for evidence of liver injury. In addition, pyrazinamide raises uric acid levels.</para>
<para id="para-00017">Rifampin and rifapentine are potent inducers of CYP3A4. These drugs can prove a challenging addition to a client’s medication regimen because induction of CYP3A4 can speed the metabolism of affected drugs and lead to therapeutic failure. Medication profiles should be examined closely and adjustments made to account for the inclusion of rifampin and rifapentine. Rifabutin has much less CYP3A4 induction and causes fewer drug interactions, making it an alternative to rifampin. Rifampin can cause the client’s secretions (e.g., urine, tears, sweat) to turn an orange to red color, which clients should be warned about before they start therapy. Rifampin is another TB drug that requires monitoring for elevations in liver function tests because it may worsen hepatic function.</para>
