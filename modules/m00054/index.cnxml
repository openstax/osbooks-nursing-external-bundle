<title>Pregnancy</title>
<para id="para-00002">During <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">pregnancy</term>, multiple changes occur within the cardiovascular system. As cardiac output increases, vascular volume increases, and there is a decrease in systemic vascular resistance and subsequent blood pressure. The vessels also dilate, which leads to lower blood pressure in the second trimester. After 20 weeks of gestation, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">blood pressure</term> increases but typically remains near pre-pregnancy levels. These changes are designed to provide perfusion—the flow of blood to tissues and organs—to the fetus (Kepley, Bates, &amp; Mohiuddin, 2023). To best support this growth and development of the fetus, the cardiovascular system of the client needs to be properly supported.</para>
<para id="para-00003">The pregnant client should increase caloric intake by 340–450 calories daily during the second and third trimesters. Increasing folic acid, iron, and choline are important as well. Pregnant women should avoid all alcohol, decrease or eliminate caffeine intake, and avoid uncooked meats and fish. Although for clients with a pre-existing condition such as <term id="term-00003">hypertension</term> (high blood pressure) and obesity, other measures will need to be incorporated into the nutritional plan (meal plan) to help prevent complications (Lu et al., 2018; Anderson-Villaluz &amp; Quam, 2022).</para>
<para id="para-00004">The food that the expectant client eats can also affect the fetus’s growing organs. Nutritional recommendations include consuming skim or low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; healthy, lean proteins including oily fish; fresh fruits and vegetables; and whole grains to help the fetus’s heart grow healthy. Pregnant clients are encouraged to avoid food high in fat, cholesterol, and sodium as this does not only affect the client, but the fetus as well (Advent Health, 2021).</para>
<para id="para-00005">Research shows that optimal nutrition during pregnancy is linked with other healthy behaviors such as an increase in physical activity and avoidance of smoking and alcohol.</para>
<section id="sect-00004">
<title>Impact on the Client’s Health During Pregnancy</title>
<para id="para-00006">The demands of pregnancy on the client significantly changes the physiological functioning of the cardiovascular system (Kepley, Bates, &amp; Mohiuddin, 2023). The increase in metabolic demand promotes optimal <term id="term-00004">uteroplacental</term> circulation—the transfer of oxygen and nutrients from client to fetus through umbilical cord and placenta—that is needed by the fetus for growth and development. The increase in the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">cardiac output</term> affects the client and the fetus by increasing pressure on the vena cava from the weight of the extra fluid within the placenta and the weight of the fetus. Vasodilation begins early in pregnancy, with a decrease in systemic vascular resistance. Maternal heart rate also increases. Other changes that occur to the cardiovascular system due to the developing fetus include rotation of the heart due to the pressure on the diaphragm, increase in heart rate, and mild hypertrophy due to the increase in vascular volume (Gersh, 2022).</para>
<para id="para-00007">Maintaining healthy nutrition for heart health during pregnancy is important because it allows the heart to cope with the stress of pregnancy. Implementing healthy heart behaviors positively impacts pregnancy and can help during delivery and the postpartum period. Healthful measures that can be taken are using added salt sparingly, increasing water intake to at least 64 oz daily, increasing protein in the diet, decreasing the amount of fried foods, exercising, avoiding alcohol and caffeine, and elevating the feet during the day (American Pregnancy Association, 2023).</para>
<para id="para-00008">Many symptoms—such as shortness of breath, increase in heart rate, and swelling—experienced during pregnancy are linked to cardiovascular changes. Decreased venous return to the head can cause the pregnant client to experience <term id="term-00006">syncope</term> in which the client loses consciousness for a brief time or <term id="term-00007">near-syncope</term> episodes where the client feels like they may pass out or have some <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">lightheadedness</term> or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">dizziness</term>. The nurse should advise the client to change positions slowly to minimize the associated risks for falls if this happens. The client may experience <term id="term-00010">dyspnea</term> or difficulty breathing with exertion and/or visible pulsations of the jugular veins, as well as edema of the lower extremities. Research also shows that not only the mother’s health is affected during pregnancy, but also the developing fetus. The choices the mother makes nutritionally can affect the fetus’s risk for heart disease, kidney disease, and metabolic disease in adulthood (Cunningham &amp; LaMarca, 2018). Consistent themes found in the research to best promote cardiovascular health during pregnancy through nutrition focus on decreasing total cholesterol levels, regulating fasting glucose levels, and maintaining normal blood pressure readings.</para>
<para id="para-00009">It is important to teach clients what food choices are best. Suggestions include educating clients on how to drink water or milk and eat fresh fruits and vegetables. When choosing meats, choose meat that is grilled rather than fried and avoid raw fish. Eating a plant-based or vegetarian diet during pregnancy has been associated with higher risks of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">congenital heart defects</term> in the neonate at birth (Yang et al., 2019). Salads are typically a good source of nutrition but can have many hidden calories in the dressings and various toppings that can be included in the salad. Clients should choose low-fat salad dressing and eat desserts sparingly (Howland, 2018).</para>

<title>The Client with Pre-existing Cardiovascular Disease</title>
<para id="para-00010"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">Cardiovascular disease</term> is a leading cause of complications in pregnant women (Cleveland Clinic, 2022a). The pregnant woman may be unaware of previous cardiovascular issues until they become pregnant. Women with previously undiagnosed cardiac issues may experience new cardiovascular-related health concerns and diagnoses due to the increase in cardiac output and decreased systemic resistance. Heart murmurs, chest pain, and generalized swelling should be evaluated by a health care provider (Gersh, 2022).</para>
<para id="para-00011">Women with <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">congenital heart disease</term> can experience an exacerbation of related cardiovascular issues from pregnancy-related physiological and hormonal changes (Ifitkhar &amp; Biswas, 2023). There is an increased risk for both maternal and fetal death associated with cardiovascular disease and pregnancy. Women who have pre-existing cardiovascular diseases need to be counseled about the additional risk factors that they could potentially encounter during pregnancy, and they need to be counseled on ways to help keep their heart and their fetus’s heart healthy.</para>
<para id="para-00012">The amount of weight that the client gains during pregnancy can impact cardiovascular health by increasing the need for higher cardiac output. For the client who gains more weight than what is recommended, the baby can be too big and lead to complications during delivery according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC, 2022b). Studies have shown that only about one-third of pregnant women gain the recommended weight during pregnancy. The recommended weight gain varies according to the pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and if the client is pregnant with one or more fetuses (CDC, 2022). To help prevent cardiovascular disease, the client should try to meet the expected <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">weight gain during pregnancy</term> by increasing calories during the second (340 additional calories) and third trimester (450 additional calories). The nurse should track and monitor pregnancy weight gain and encourage the client to eat a well-balanced diet to help prevent cardiovascular problems during pregnancy (CDC, 2022).</para>

<title>Impact on the Fetus</title>
<para id="para-00020">The fetus of a client with <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">cardiovascular disease</term> is at an increased risk for morbidity, cardiovascular disorders—inherited and congenital—premature delivery, and a restriction in fetal growth and development (Russell, 2022). Fetal growth and development restriction, related to inadequate placental perfusion, also increases the risk for fetal demise. Additionally, infants born to client’s experiencing poorly controlled cardiovascular disease complications during pregnancy were noted to experience small gestational weight measurements and extreme prematurity. An infant who is preterm also has reduced cardiomyocyte proliferation, which affects the total number of cardiac cells they have. The decrease in myocytes affects the heart’s ability to repair itself and can decrease the function of the heart (Bensley et al., 2018). Some cardiac problems that infants can develop from prematurity include, but are not limited to, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">patent ductus arteriosus</term> (<link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00054"/>) and low blood pressure (Mayo Clinic, 2023c).</para>

<para id="para-00021">Superior nutrition during pregnancy is important not only for the mother but for the developing fetus. Women who have a limited intake of fruits, vegetables, fish, meats, and dairy can have infants who are stillborn or have a low birth weight; the fetus could also have developmental delays. Mothers who lack nutrients such as iodine, folate, calcium, and zinc can have complications during pregnancy that could potentially result in material death (UNICEF, 2023). Research shows that if a mother has <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">gestational diabetes</term>, there are cellular changes that occur within the developing heart of the fetus. It is important to monitor the mother’s blood glucose and if she does have diabetes, make sure the glucose is under control. Cellular changes that occur during the development of the heart of the fetus have been linked to high glucose levels in the mother (Garg, 2020).</para>

<title>Infancy</title>
<para id="para-00027">For healthy infants born without cardiovascular disorders, research data indicates that <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">breastfeeding</term> for the first 6 months is best because it provides the infant with optimal nutrition. The goal is to breastfeed infants for a full year while introducing solid foods (CDC, 2023e). Infants who are breastfed have a decreased risk for subsequent cardiovascular-related diseases such as obesity and type 1 diabetes. Commercially made formulas are developed to mimic breast milk. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">Infant formula</term>s must meet the nutritional requirements that are set by the federal government (FDA, 2023). The FDA recommends that <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020">formula</term> preparations include calcium, fats, folate, iron, protein and carbohydrates in the appropriate amounts for infants. Additionally, micronutrients of zinc, vitamins A, C, D, E, K, and B vitamins are included in the recommendations (Watson, 2022). To ensure the infant receives the correct amount of these macro and micronutrients, it is important to provide the formula as prepared or reconstitute as directed. Watering down the formula will not provide the infant with the nutrients needed to support growth and development.</para>
<para id="para-00028">Complementary foods can be added to the diet after the infant is 6 months old. Complementary foods include iron-fortified infant cereals, pureed vegetables, and fruits. As more food is introduced to the infant, food choices should include fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and whole milks, such as pumpkin, apples, pears, carrots, peas, and pureed lean meats. Commercially prepared infant foods are available in various stages of infant development. Home-prepared foods should be pureed to a consistency that is easy for the baby to eat with all peelings and seeds removed (Advent Health, 2021) or cut into small pieces to avoid <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00021">choking</term>.</para>
<note class="special-considerations" id="note-00003">
<title>Foods and Drinks to Avoid with Infants</title>
<para id="para-00029">Specific food items should be avoided until 12 months of age. Infants under 12 months should avoid honey, due to the potential for botulism, unpasteurized drinks/foods, foods high in salt or sugar, caffeinated drinks, cow’s milk, and fish high in mercury (CDC, 2023b). Other foods that should be avoided that could potentially cause harm are nuts, sunflower seeds, cherries with pits, raw carrots, popcorn, hard candy, raw apples and pears, grapes, cheese cubes, and hot dogs or sausage because these have the potential to lodge in the infant’s trachea and block the airway. Peanut butter and chewing gum can also make the mouth sticky and get lodged in the airway (Nemours Children’s Health, 2023).</para>
</note>
<para id="para-00030">Infants with <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00022">congenital heart disease</term> require additional calories to support growth and development (Royal Brompton and Harefield Hospitals, 2021). Babies with congenital heart disease may experience fatigue and typically require more calories daily than the average infant. Many of these babies cannot eat or drink enough to meet their caloric needs. The pediatrician can recommend supplementing breast milk or prescribe a high calorie formula. Baby foods that are higher in calories are bananas with tapioca, mango with tapioca, prunes and rice, mixed vegetables, and sweet potatoes. Many others can be obtained from the grocery store in the baby food aisle (American Heart Association, 2023; Royal Brompton and Harefield Hospitals, 2021). Formulas that the provider can prescribe include Infatrini and Similac High Energy with 100 calories and 2.6 g of protein per 100 mLs, in comparison to the standard formula, which has 70 calories and 1.5 g of protein per 100 mLs (Royal Brompton and Harefield Hospitals, 2021). Infants who have heart issues also may require nasogastric tube feeds to help keep up with their nutritional needs.</para>
<para id="para-00031">Feeding during infancy is an opportunity to introduce infants to a heart-healthy diet and encourage food likes that will extend throughout their lifecycle. Promoting a rainbow of foods and allowing the infant to explore a variety of textures and consistencies will promote a healthy relationship with food as a fuel source that will encourage and sustain growth and development. Limiting processed, high-fat, high-sugar, and high-sodium foods in infancy will develop a pattern of utilizing nutrient-dense foods for fuel across the lifespan.</para>

<title>Childhood</title>
<para id="para-00032">The heart healthy <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00023">eating behaviors</term> of infancy should also be followed in childhood, including calorie consumption that supports the growth and developmental needs of the child. As these needs fluctuate, children should take the lead on how much food they consume; parents and caregivers can allow then to stop eating when they are full rather than promoting a clean plate (American Heart Association, 2018). Foods low in added sugar, saturated fats, cholesterol, and salt should be the focus of a healthy childhood diet. A <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">childhood diet</term> should be rich in a variety of colorful foods; 30–35% of daily caloric intake should be mono- or polyunsaturated fats from olive oil or canola oil.

<para id="para-00033">Developing a meal-time routine as a family—where the child is involved in the meal preparation—helps to build life-long healthy eating habits. Including children in the preparation of food and teaching them to make healthy nutritional choices is something parents can incorporate into their meals each day. Kids can help by washing the fruits and vegetables, setting the table, and helping prepare things that are at their cognitive and coordination levels. Involving children in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00025">meal preparation</term> makes them feel they have choices in what they eat, and with the parents’ help they are making healthier choices. When eating fast food children can learn to choose healthy options such as carrot sticks instead of French fries, yogurt instead of hashbrowns or other sides that are fried in grease, and fresh fruit instead of baked goods high in added sugar.</para>
<para id="para-00034">Childhood is the optimal time to develop and reinforce heart-healthy dietary eating behaviors that support growth and development throughout life. Heart-healthy nutritional patterns such as watching portion sizes, eating low-fat dairy, limiting saturated fats, and increasing fruits and vegetables in the diet can help decrease the likelihood of obesity, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension in childhood and later as an adult (Cleveland Clinic, 2022c).</para>

<para id="para-00042">Although many aspects of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00027">social media</term> are not viewed positively, social media can provide information about heart-healthy behavior in a way that positively impacts adolescent behaviors (Mayo Clinic, 2022a). The use of digital media has been noted to be effective in providing adolescents with information when and where they seek it (Mayo Clinic, 2022a). Additionally, utilizing social media assists teens in establishing a feeling of connection with their peers, which can foster healthy behaviors (Anderson et al., 2022). Social media also reduces barriers to information, increasing the accessibility of heart-healthy information available to this age group. Parents and nurses can balance the positive implications with an awareness of the negative implications of social media. Research has indicated one of the best ways to help alleviate negative impacts that social media can play on the teen is for parents to have open communication with their teens.</para>
<para id="para-00043">Eating disorders, such as purging, binging, or limiting food/not eating certain foods, are more prevalent among female adolescents than males. In the U.S. it is estimated that 10 in 100 young women have an eating disorder (American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry, 2018). Teens can become withdrawn, and family may recognize weight loss in individuals suffering from eating disorders. Recognizing these symptoms is crucial to the health of the teenager.</para>
<para id="para-00044">In addition to diminished mental health, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">eating disorders</term> lead to diminished physical health: electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalemia and hyponatremia; increased liver enzymes; increased bilirubin levels; anemia; and leukopenia. These changes can affect the electrocardiogram by prolonging QT intervals, causing bradycardia, and ventricular tachycardia. The effects of these disorders can decrease the blood pressure and cause a higher risk for heart problems, such as cardiomyopathy, by causing the larger walls of the heart to become thicker and lose their ability to pump blood (Sarder et al., 2015). Clients with <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029">anorexia</term> typically have an amino acid deficiency because they do not consume enough protein, which is essential for bodily function. Without enough protein, the body will use the available protein for vital functions and the other nonessential functions will shut down. Nails become brittle, menstruation ceases, muscles begin to thin and waste, and the essential functions that help to regulate the heart become altered. Heart abnormalities are commonly seen in severe anorexia due to cardiac muscle cell death (Comprehensive Psychiatric Resources, 2023).</para>

<para id="para-00049">The use of the heart-healthy diet has been shown to help lower bad cholesterol (LDL) and increase good cholesterol (HDL). Additionally, avoiding or minimizing processed foods and high-sugar foods and drinks has a positive impact on heart health. Foods, such as red meats and high-fat dairy products that are high in saturated fat, should be reduced to help lower LDL levels. Adding whey protein to the diet can help decrease LDL and total cholesterol (Amirani et al., 2020). Increasing intake of omega-3—by increasing foods such as salmon, mackerel, and walnuts—can reduce blood pressure. Clients can increase soluble fiber in the diet by eating oatmeal, kidney beans, and apples, which can help decrease the absorption of cholesterol in the body leading to overall changes in cholesterol levels. Exercise and quitting smoking can also help improve HDL levels (Mayo Clinic, 2023b). Adhering to these dietary patterns can impact individual cholesterol levels to decrease the risk for developing atherosclerosis and further cardiovascular diseases.</para>
<para id="para-00050">Alcohol consumption has been shown to have negative effects on cardiovascular health, leading to hypertension, <term id="term-00042">heart failure</term>, and stroke. Drinking excessively—women more than 4 drinks per day and men more than 5 drinks per day—can also lead to cardiomyopathy, which affects the ability of the heart to pump effectively (John Hopkins Medicine, 2023). An alcoholic drink is defined as 0.6 of fluid ethanol per drink (National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 2022). In a study that consisted of 371,463 participants, Biddinger et al (2022), showed an increased risk for hypertension and coronary artery disease with <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00043">alcohol consumption</term>.</para>
<para id="para-00051">In addition to educating clients on controlling cholesterol, triglyceride, and blood pressure levels and avoiding alcohol, nurses should inform clients about appropriate nutritional plans to combat cardiovascular disease. Nutritional plans should be low in processed food, sugary drinks, saturated fats, fatty dairy products, and sodium (Mayo Clinic, 2023e). The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is an appropriate recommendation because it includes a diet high in fruits and vegetables, unsaturated fats, whole grains, fish, legumes, and low-fat dairy.

Although preventative care fostering a healthy cardiovascular system is the optimal desire, research indicates that there is an increase in cardiovascular disease as people age. The incidence of cardiovascular disease increases from approximately 40% in adults ages 40–59 to 75% from ages 60–79, and approximately 86% in those above age 80 (Rodgers et al., 2019). Depending on the activity level of the client, the older adult typically needs about 2000 calories daily. Additionally, healthy older adults need increased dietary fiber, calcium, vitamin D, and potassium; healthy older adults should decrease their consumption of saturated fats, sodium, and added sugars (FDA, 2022a).

<caption>Daily Nutritional Needs for Later Adulthood (source: U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2020a)</caption>
</table>
<para id="para-00059">As people age, many age-related changes occur that can affect nutritional needs. Many adults experience heart complications from coronary artery disease, valvular disease, high cholesterol, heart failure, and arrhythmias. These clients are typically placed on multiple medications to treat their condition. However, the nurse can educate clients on nutrition and other lifestyle strategies to help clients manage their symptoms. Nutritional needs for a healthy heart include eating a variety of fruits and vegetables; eating whole grains; choosing healthy proteins such as nuts, fish, and seafood; decreasing intake of highly processed foods; minimizing intake of added sugars; using herbs instead of salt for seasoning or choosing low-sodium foods; and limiting alcohol intake. The nurse should also instruct clients on the importance of smoking cessation (American Heart Association, 2021). Another consideration is how nutrition can interact with medications clients take to treat their heart disease.</para>
