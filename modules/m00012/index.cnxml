      <title>Normal Function of the Digestive Organs</title>
      <para id="para-00001">Before food ever enters the body, the sensory system, an accessory system to the gastrointestinal system, assists in the start of the digestive process. The sight and smell of food as well as the feel of food entering the mouth and the taste of food when it first contacts the tongue all influence the desire to eat. These senses also trigger the salivary glands to start the release of saliva in the anticipation of eating, which will help with the breakdown of food once it enters the oral cavity.</para>

        <title>Inportant Newborn Assessment</title>
        <para id="para-00003">
          For a newborn, anal patency should be established. This is done by two means: first, the rectal temperature is taken by using a lubricated rectal thermometer and inserting it one to two centimeters to record the newborn’s temperature, and secondly, the passage of their first meconium stool confirms patency (Gantan &amp; Wiedrich, 2022).
        </para>

      <para id="para-00004">When food enters the body, the first organ it will contact is the mouth. Within the mouth, or oral cavity, are the tongue, teeth, and salivary glands. The teeth will cut, bite, chew, and grind food down into smaller particles. The teeth work together seamlessly with the tongue, which aids in the <term id="term-00001">mastication</term> process by use of mechanical compression, abrasion, and distortion (Ogobuiro et al., 2022). As the tongue performs these mechanical processes, it also secretes mucins and lingual lipase to help break down lipids. At the same time, the parotid, sublingual, and submandibular salivary glands release a mixture of buffers, glycoproteins known as mucins, and salivary amylase which assist in lubrication of foods for swallowing and starting the process of lipid and complex carbohydrate and starch digestion (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 2022; Ogobuiro et al., 2022).</para>
      <para id="para-00005">The next stop for the food will be in the pharynx. In order to swallow food into the esophagus and not the trachea, the swallowing center in the brain stem of the central nervous system triggers certain actions during swallowing. The nasopharynx is closed off by the rise of the soft palette when the tongue initiates swallowing by pushing food to the back of the mouth and the larynx is closed in the pharynx to prevent food from entering the trachea (Ogobuiro et al., 2022). Once this swallowing reflex is initiating, it cannot be stopped until completed.</para>
      <para id="para-00006">While in the stomach, food is temporarily stored while mechanical and chemical processes break it down further into a substance known as chyme. The stomach uses its three muscular layers (the inner oblique, middle circular, and external longitudinal layers) to contract and relax in a mixing and churning action to help mechanically break down food. To assist with the chemical breakdown of food, the stomach secretes stomach acids, specifically hydrochloric acid secreted by the parietal cells in the stomach, and enzymes, such as <term id="term-00002">pepsin</term>, <term id="term-00003">somatostatin</term>, and <term id="term-00004">gastrin</term> (Ogobuiro et al., 2022). The stomach is also responsible for secreting <term id="term-00005">intrinsic factor</term> from the parietal cells to be able to absorb Vitamin B12 from the food as it is being digested.</para>

      <title>Pathophysiology Associated with Digestive Organs and Function</title>
      <para id="para-00007">Many causes of diseases and disorders that impact the gastrointestinal system are linked with nutrition, as are many of their treatments or controls. The digestive system not only is responsible for ensuring the rest of the body is nourished, it is also responsible for nourishing itself. Diseases of this system can impact any portion of the system, from the mouth to the anus and the accessory organs.</para>
      <para id="para-00008">Starting in the oral cavity, the client can experience salivary gland tumors, gingivitis of the gums, periodontal disease, and cancers in the mouth. In infants, they can have malformations such as cleft lip or palate which causes a long fissure in the palate of the mouth and lip. This malformation makes feeding an infant dangerous, and a nasogastric tube is needed until repair can be made. These malformations have been linked to maternal deficiency of vitamin B12 in their diets during pregnancy and can cause nutritional deficiencies in the infant until corrected (Munger et al, 2021).</para>
      <para id="para-00009">Diseases in the accessory organs can include cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, cirrhosis, hepatitis, pancreatitis, biliary atresia, Gilbert syndrome, Dublin-Johnson syndrome, Crigler-Najjar syndrome, liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, pancreatic stones, pancreatic pseudocyst, choledocholithiasis, hemochromatosis, and Wilson’s disease (Cleveland Clinic, 2022b). In the rectum and anus, diseases can include anal fissures, anal fistulas, rectal cancer, perianal abscesses, and internal and external hemorrhoids. Infants can suffer from neonatal cholestasis (or a failure of bile to flow) that can result from malformation, biliary cysts that block the biliary tree, or inspissated bile duct syndrome in cystic fibrosis and result in hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice (Cochran, 2022f).</para>

        <para id="para-00010">One overarching goal of Healthy People 2030 is to remove health disparities and improve health literacy in all people. Health literacy is the ability to access, understand, and use health information and services to make informed decisions about one's health. <link url="https://health.gov/healthypeople/priority-areas/health-literacy-healthy-people-2030">Healthy People 2030 identifies health literacy as being vital to reaching all Healthy People 2030 objectives</link>. However, health information can be difficult to understand, especially in those with limited proficiency in English. Healthy People 2030 has expanded its definition of health literacy to include not only what individuals can do to improve health literacy, but also to emphasize the role that organizations play in helping individuals find, comprehend, and utilize health information and services so they can participate in decisions about their care. Additionally, this new definition goes beyond simply ensuring that individuals understand health information; it focuses on the individual’s ability to utilize this information to make “well-informed” choices, not just “appropriate” choices.</para>

      <para id="para-00012">Dietary deficiencies or excesses that have been attributed to low gastrointestinal mobility, which leads to constipation and hemorrhoids, fissures, and fistulas, include low intake of fiber, low water intake, high dairy intake (Cleveland Clinic, 2022b). Dietary deficiencies or excesses that have been linked with increased risks of gastrointestinal cancers include low fiber intake, low water intake, high fat intake, and high cholesterol intake. Gastrointestinal reflux disease is made worse by food that contain caffeine, spicy foods, acidic foods, and dairy products. Celiac disease requires the client to avoid all products that contain gluten to prevent serious consequences from the disease such as villous atrophy with inability to absorb nutrients.</para>

      <title>Aging of the Digestive System</title>
      <para id="para-00013">There are some specific changes to consider with ageing in regard to the digestive system that impact the function of the system and the overall nutrition status of older adults. Older adults tend to have a decrease in appetite over younger adults. There are multiple reasons for this reduced appetite. Older adults tend to be on multiple medications which can decrease their desire to eat, cause nausea, and restrict their dietary food choices due to drug interactions. Older adults also tend to have more comorbidities, causing more restrictions on their diet and decreasing their desire to eat. Many older adults may become lactose intolerant because the production of the lactase enzyme reduces with age, restricting dietary options (Bartel, 2022; Nigam &amp; Knight, 2017).</para>
      <para id="para-00014">As part of normal ageing, the senses of smell and taste can decrease, and often sight can be diminished causing less desire to eat because individuals use these senses to choose what they want to eat and how much (Nigam &amp; Knight, 2017). Also, physically, appetite decreases due to changes in the release of hormones that control appetite (ghrelin, peptide tyrosine [PYY], cholecystokinin [CCK], insulin, and leptin).</para>
      <para id="para-00015">As individuals age, increased dry mouth, gum retraction, shrinking of the maxillary and mandibular bones, reduction of calcium reserves that increase tooth decay, slowing of the muscular contractions that initiate swallowing, loss of tension in the upper and lower esophageal sphincters, slowing of esophageal peristalsis, and possible loss of gag reflex can impact the ability to safely swallow, calling for a need to change diet consistency to a pureed or liquid form which affects the perceived attractiveness of food and further decreases appetite (Bartel, 2022; Nigam &amp; Knight, 2017).</para>
      <para id="para-00016">Older adults are not able to eat as much because their stomach walls lose elasticity as they age, making it less able to accommodate food. Many older adults will lose some secretion of the hydrochloric acid into the stomach to help digest food, and they have a slower gastric emptying. These changes cause older adults to feel fuller faster and longer, decreasing appetite.</para>
      <para id="para-00017">Due to loss of tension in the lower esophageal sphincter, older adults often experience from reflux because stomach contents can backflow easier into the esophagus (Nigam &amp; Knight, 2017). The hyposecretion of hydrochloric acid and protective mucous that occurs with age can result in chronic atrophic gastritis, increased peptic ulcer disease, and decreased Vitamin B12 absorption.</para>
      <para id="para-00018">Older adults tend to experience more with bloating and abdominal pain as well as decreased absorption of calcium, folic acid, and iron in the small intestines due to an increase of the bacterial populations that reside in the small intestines that occurs with increased age (Bartel, 2022; Nigam &amp; Knight, 2017). The pancreas and liver further reduce the ability of the small intestines to absorb nutrients because, with age, the pancreas decreases its release of digestive enzymes reducing complete digestion of proteins and fats, and the liver decreases its production of bile to assist with protein and fat digestion, decreases its rate of protein synthesis and metabolism, and decreases in its ability to detoxify substances (Nigam &amp; Knight, 2017). There is also an increased risk of constipation with older adults because, in the large intestines, there are reductions in neurotransmitters and neuroreceptors, atrophies of mucosa and muscle layers, formations of diverticula, declines in the rate of cell division in the digestive epithelium, and increases in inflammation conditions due to the increase in facultative anaerobes. The increase in constipation increases the risk of the development of hemorrhoids.</para>
      <para id="para-00019">All the changes make it important that the older client is educated to ensure they are eating nutrient-dense options to ensure they are getting adequate nutritional intake. They are likely to require less caloric intake since their metabolic rate decreases with age, so caloric intake does not need to increase, only the nutritional value of the foods they ingest.</para>

        <title>Subtitle to Preview Focus of Case Study</title>
        <para id="para-00020">Jennifer Davis had a difficult pregnancy. Prior to conceiving, she suffered from diabetes mellitus types 2, hypertension, chronic moderate anemia, and chronic kidney disease stage 2. During the pregnancy, despite being very compliant, her kidney disease advanced. She closely followed her diet restrictions for low sodium, low sugar, low carbohydrate, low fat, and low protein, and as she progressed into closer to kidney failure she had to start a fluid restriction as well. Despite these actions, after delivery she was diagnosed with end-stage renal disease and was scheduled to have a permcath placed for the start of hemodialysis.</para>
        <para id="para-00021">Due to her health issues, she suffered from preeclampsia that developed into eclampsia that required an emergency cesarean delivery of her infant, Carrie Davis, at 32 weeks gestation. Her infant suffered effects from Jennifer’s health issues as well. Due to her chronic anemia, diet restrictions, and pre-term delivery, the infant was born small-for-gestational-age and low birthweight due to intrauterine growth restrictions and required four days of care in the NICU after birth.</para>
        <para id="para-00022">The client, Carrie Davis is now one week old. She weighs 1 kilogram and is 13 inches long.</para>
