  <title>Hypertension</title>
  <para id="para-00002">The cardiovascular system transports blood and oxygen throughout the body. Blood flows from a system of higher resistance to one of lower resistance—from arteries to capillaries to veins. Blood pressure (see <link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00287"/>) represents the force that blood flow exerts on arterial walls.</para>

  <para id="para-00003">The two elements that determine blood pressure are cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance. <term id="term-00001">Cardiac output</term> (CO) is the volume of blood pumped by the heart per unit of time, usually measured in liters per minute. The CO is determined by the <term id="term-00002">heart rate</term> (HR), the number of times the heart beats per minute, and <term id="term-00003">stroke volume</term> (SV)—the amount of blood ejected with each heartbeat—and is represented by the following equation: <m:math><m:mi>CO</m:mi><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:mi>HR</m:mi><m:mo>×</m:mo><m:mi>SV</m:mi></m:math>.</para>
  <para id="para-00004">Blood pressure is determined by examining both systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings. The <term id="term-00004">systolic blood pressure</term> reading represents the amount of pressure within the arteries when the heart contracts, whereas the <term id="term-00005">diastolic blood pressure</term> reading reflects the amount of pressure when the heart is at rest between beats. The diastolic blood pressure reading, which is the lower pressure within the arteries and vessels, determines the <term id="term-00006">peripheral vascular resistance</term> (also known as systemic vascular resistance) by measuring blood flow and the level of constriction or dilatation within the arteries and vessels. Blood pressure (BP) is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and is expressed as the systolic pressure over the diastolic pressure (for instance, 125/90 mm Hg).</para>
  <para id="para-00005">Hypertension occurs when an individual’s blood pressure is above normal limits for a sustained period of time. Hypertension can be either primary (essential) hypertension or secondary hypertension. Primary hypertension is caused by unknown elements; however, some studies have implicated genetics and behavioral and environmental factors, including age, high salt intake, insulin resistance, obesity, high alcohol intake, sedentary lifestyle, smoking, and stress (Aggarwal et al., 2023; Iqbal &amp; Jamal, 2022). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (n.d.), approximately 116 million adults in the United States have hypertension.</para>
  <para id="para-00006">Importantly, hypertension is not limited to adults; it can also affect <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020">children and adolescents</term>. In the United States and other countries, primary hypertension affects up to 5% of individuals in this younger age group. Developing high blood pressure during childhood can have long-term consequences, potentially leading to hypertension in adulthood and increasing the risk of heart disease, stroke, and kidney damage. Certain modifiable risk factors can be addressed for this population to improve blood pressure levels, including obesity, physical activity, and nutrition. Health care providers should always assess blood pressure in the pediatric population to promote preventive measures within families and foster healthy lifestyle habits (American Heart Association, 2023).</para>
  <para id="para-00007">Secondary hypertension results from other conditions involving the central nervous system, endocrine system, and renal system and is treated along with the underlying condition. Secondary hypertension may be cured if the treatment for the underlying condition is successful.</para>
  <para id="para-00008">Hormones also impact blood pressure regulation. The <term id="term-00007">renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)</term> and vasopressin are the main physiologic regulatory systems or pathways affecting blood pressure homeostasis. RAAS, as illustrated in <link target-id="fig-00002" document="m00287"/>, is a compensatory mechanism the body activates during <term id="term-00008">hypotension</term> (when blood pressure is low). Renin is released from the kidneys in response to low blood pressure. Renin interacts with angiotensinogen and converts it to <term id="term-00009">angiotensin I</term>. The angiotensin-converting enzyme in the pulmonary blood vessel endothelium is then triggered to produce <term id="term-00010">angiotensin II</term>, which constricts arterioles, increasing peripheral resistance and increasing blood pressure. Angiotensin II also stimulates the adrenal medulla to produce catecholamine, which yields <term id="term-00011">aldosterone</term>. Aldosterone causes the kidneys to retain water and sodium, which leads to water retention and results in an increased blood volume, cardiac output, and blood pressure. <term id="term-00012">Vasopressin</term> is an antidiuretic hormone that regulates reabsorption of water by the kidneys; it is released by the pituitary gland in response to low blood volume. Vasopressin causes retention of body fluids, vasoconstriction, and increased blood pressure.</para>

  <media alt="A diagram shows the path the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) follows in the human body in response to low blood pressure. Organs that are involved in RAAS include the kidneys, liver, blood vessels, lungs, adrenal glands, pituitary gland, and the hypothalamus.">

  <title>Grades of Hypertension</title>
  <para id="para-00012">The American Heart Association (AHA) (n.d.a) reports that prolonged elevation of blood pressure leads to the deterioration of blood vessels. The deterioration of blood vessels is measured by <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">grades of hypertension</term>. Normal blood pressure is a systolic reading of less than 120 mm Hg and a diastolic reading of less than 80 mm Hg. Elevated blood pressure and hypertension increase the risk of vascular damage and decrease oxygenation. The chart below from the American College of Cardiology and AHA (see <link target-id="table-00001" document="m00287"/>) demonstrates the blood pressure categories and the readings associated with them.</para>

  <title>Diagnostics</title>
  <para id="para-00013">A physical examination by a health care provider with a sphygmomanometer (blood pressure cuff or device) will identify an elevated blood pressure, and a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG, EKG) can assist in determining if the heart has a normal or abnormal rhythm. The health care provider also obtains blood work to determine factors that contribute to the client’s hypertension as well as how the body is reacting to elevated blood pressure. These laboratory tests include a complete blood cell count (CBC), basic electrolyte panel, cholesterol panel, and renal function. An echocardiogram—an ultrasound of the heart—is not typically included in diagnostic procedures to determine hypertension; however, the health care provider may add this diagnostic study to visualize the heart’s chambers, valves, and pumping action to determine the effect of hypertension on the heart, which may cause other disorders such as hypertrophy of the heart. The health care provider bases the diagnosis for hypertension on the findings of the physical examination and the diagnostic study results.</para>

  <section id="sect-00005">
  <title>Clinical Manifestations</title>
  <para id="para-00014"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">Symptoms of hypertension</term> may not occur for years, and most of the time, the symptoms can be silent. Symptoms typically associated with hypertension include elevated blood pressure readings, headaches, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, and neurological disturbances such as disorientation or a decreased level of consciousness. Over time, uncontrolled hypertension can lead to organ damage. Clients can experience symptoms related to the specific organ that is damaged; for example, if hypertension is left untreated, it may cause renal insufficiency, which may then continue to deteriorate, causing kidney damage and leading to end-stage renal disease that requires dialysis.</para>
  </section>
  <section id="sect-00006">
  <title>Nonpharmacologic Treatment for Hypertension</title>
  <para id="para-00015">Nonpharmacologic measures used to treat hypertension center around lifestyle changes. Lifestyle changes focus on the client’s personal, social, and cultural influences. These changes may include diet modification, increased physical activity and exercise, smoking cessation, alcohol consumption reduction, relaxation techniques, and self-monitoring.</para>
  <note class="trending-today" id="note-00002">

  <section id="sect-00007">
  <title>Dietary Modification</title>
  <para id="para-00018">Clients with hypertension should eat a low-sodium diet consisting of whole grains, vegetables, and fruits. Other recommendations include low-fat dairy products and limiting meat intake to about two servings daily of lean meat, such as fish and poultry (Challa &amp; Ameer, 2023). Reducing sweets and red meat is also important. The AHA (n.d.b) recommends 1500 mg to no more than 2300 mg of sodium intake daily. Dietary patterns and nutritional therapy should focus on food preferences, social and cultural influences, and appropriate caloric intake.</para>
  </section>
  <section id="sect-00008">
  <title>Physical Activity and Exercise</title>
  <para id="para-00019">The AHA (n.d.d) recommends 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity weekly. Average time for exercise should be at least 30–40 minutes per session to assist in decreasing blood pressure. If the client cannot do 30–40 minutes of moderate exercise four times a week, the nurse should suggest an alternate exercise plan, emphasizing that some physical activity is better than no physical activity. Physical activity and exercise enhance weight reduction and promote a healthy lifestyle.</para>
  </section>
  <section id="sect-00009">
  <title>Smoking Cessation and Reducing Alcohol Consumption</title>
  <para id="para-00020">Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of coronary artery disease. Smoking increases sympathetic nervous system activity, which causes vasoconstriction and, therefore, increases blood pressure, heart rate, and myocardial contractility. Although smoking has been established as a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease, its relationship to high blood pressure is still being investigated. Nevertheless, smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke contribute to increased accumulation of fatty deposits within the arteries, which high blood pressure is known to accelerate (AHA, n.d.c).</para>
  <para id="para-00021">Alcohol consumption increases blood pressure by increasing the level of the hormone renin in the blood. Renin decreases fluid elimination, causing higher fluid volume in the body and arterial vasoconstriction that results in an increase in blood pressure. Reducing alcohol consumption has been shown to decrease systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure by 5–12 mm Hg (Wake, 2021).</para>
  </section>
  <section id="sect-00010">
  <title>Relaxation Techniques</title>
  <para id="para-00022">According to Harvard Health Publishing (2022), meditation has been associated with reducing blood pressure. Herawati et al. (2023) adds that slow breathing can be used as a nonpharmacological treatment to lower blood pressure. The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (2021) reviewed research on relaxation and blood pressure control that showed relaxation techniques resulted in small reductions in blood pressure and demonstrated yoga may be used as an adjunct intervention for the management of hypertension.</para>
  <note class="clinical-tip" id="note-00003">
  <title>Assessing Client Lifestyle Modifications</title>
  <para id="para-00023">The nurse should work closely with the client to promote lifestyle changes—such as diet modifications and weight loss, increase in exercise, smoking cessation, and use of relaxation techniques—that will improve baseline blood pressure readings.</para>

  <title>Self-Monitoring of Hypertension</title>
  <para id="para-00024">Home blood pressure monitoring (<link target-id="fig-00003" document="m00287"/>) contributes to the comprehension of hypertension and facilitates the awareness of the importance of blood pressure management. Clients are now able to monitor their blood pressure with electronic blood pressure devices. Home blood pressure monitoring leads to awareness of one’s blood pressure, better blood pressure control, and adherence to lifestyle changes and drug therapies (Verma et al., 2021).</para>

  <title>Pharmacologic Treatment of Hypertension</title>
  <para id="para-00025">Pharmacologic treatment of hypertension centers on the individual client and takes into consideration their lifestyle as well as their personal, social, and cultural preferences. The objectives of pharmacological treatment are to reduce blood pressure and reduce the long-term effects of hypertension like organ damage. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta-adrenergic blockers, calcium channel blockers, and thiazide-like diuretics (Khalil &amp; Zeltser, 2022) are the primary antihypertensive drugs used to treat high blood pressure. These drugs are discussed in detail later in this chapter.</para>
  <note class="clinical-tip" id="note-00004">
  <title>Assessing Therapeutic Effects</title>
  <para id="para-00026">The nurse should monitor the client’s blood pressure to assess for drug efficacy. If blood pressure remains elevated despite antihypertensive treatment, the health care provider may adjust antihypertensive drugs to better control the client’s blood pressure.</para>

  <title>Angina</title>
  <para id="para-00027"><term id="term-00015">Angina</term> (also called angina pectoris) is characterized by discomfort in the front of the chest, neck, shoulders, jaw, or arms that is precipitated by physical exertions and relieved by rest within 5 minutes or sublingual nitrates (Ueng et al., 2023). Angina is caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. The four types of angina (AHA, 2022a) are listed below:</para>
  <list id="list-00002">
  <item><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">Stable angina</term> is the most common form. It often occurs during activity and may sometimes occur at rest. Stable angina is predictable and follows a pattern of similar episodes of chest pain.</item>
  <item><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">Unstable angina</term> is unpredictable and considered a medical emergency. Unlike stable angina, unstable angina usually occurs during rest and does not follow a pattern of similar episodes of chest pain; episodes may last longer than stable angina episodes. If blood flow to the heart does not improve, a myocardial infarction (heart attack) may occur.</item>
  <item><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">Variant (Prinzmetal) angina</term>, unlike the other forms of angina, is not caused by coronary artery disease but rather by a spasm in the heart’s arteries that temporarily decreases blood flow and almost always occurs at rest. </item>
  <item><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">Microvascular angina</term> is frequent episodes of angina that occur due to coronary microvascular disease.</item>
  </list>
  <para id="para-00028">Risk factors for stable, unstable, and microvascular angina include age, family history, tobacco use, diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Risk factors for Prinzmetal angina may be caused by anything that leads to spasms of the coronary arteries including certain medications such as decongestants, use of substances such as cannabis and cocaine, smoking tobacco, and stress (AHA, 2022a).</para>

  <section id="sect-00014">
  <title>Pharmacologic Treatment of Angina</title>
  <para id="para-00029">Pharmacologic treatment for angina is individualized. Client lifestyle, as well as social and cultural influences, impact the health care provider’s treatment choice. The goal for pharmacologic treatment of stable angina is to prevent an ischemic event—like myocardial ischemia or infarction (heart attack)—from occurring. Nitrates are the first line of treatment for angina along with beta-adrenergic blockers and calcium channel blockers (Rousan &amp; Thadani, 2019). Both types of blockers will be discussed further in this chapter.</para>
