    <para id="para-00002">Terrorist attacks use force or violence against civilians, cause mass property damage, and create fear and panic among the public. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear</term> (CBRN) agents have been used as weapons against humans, causing devastating health consequences (Bland, 2014). Chemical agents include nerve agents, vesicant agents, cyanides, pulmonary agents, incapacitants, toxic industrial chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and riot-control agents. Biological agents include live pathogens, such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses, and toxins derived from bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals. Radiological agents have ionizing radiation present, such as alpha, beta, gamma, and neutron participles. Nuclear agents are materials used to generate nuclear power.</para>
    <para id="para-00003"><term id="term-00002">Biological terrorism</term>, or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">bioterrorism</term>, is the intentional release of biological agents into the atmosphere or environment to threaten a civilian population. Humans and animals absorb the biological agent through inhalation, ingestion, skin, mucous membranes, or eyes (Bland, 2014). Bioterrorism can cause disease or death among a large number of people or livestock and can contaminate food or water supplies. Inhalation of biological agents poses the greatest risk for multiple casualties because the agent is transferred through the air and can reach larger numbers of the population (Bland, 2014).</para>

    <title>Categorization of Bioterrorism Agents</title>
    <para id="para-00004">As discussed in <link document="m00167">Pandemics and Infectious Disease Outbreaks</link>, biological agents that would likely be used as agents of bioterrorism include bacteria, viruses, and toxins. The CDC categorizes these agents by risk threat (see <link target-id="table-00001" document="m00355"/> for examples). Most biological agents are difficult to grow and maintain, as many are destroyed quickly when exposed to sunlight and other environmental factors (CDC, 2018; Siegel et al., 2023). Other agents, such as anthrax spores, are heartier and live much longer, especially on surfaces. Biological agents can be dispersed by spraying them into the air, infecting animals that carry the disease to humans, and contaminating food and water (Bland, 2014). Delivery methods include:</para>
    <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00002">
    <item>Aerosols: Biological agents are circulated into the air via a fine mist that may carry for miles. Inhaling the agent may cause disease in people or animals.</item>
    <item>Animals: Diseases are spread by insects and animals, such as fleas, mice, flies, mosquitoes, and livestock.</item>
    <item>Food and water contamination: Pathogenic organisms and toxins are released into food and water supplies. If contamination is known, most microorganisms can be killed and toxins deactivated by cooking food and boiling water for 1 minute or longer.</item>
    <item>Person-to-person: Communicable diseases such as smallpox and plague can be spread via close human contact.</item>

    </table>
    <para id="para-00005">Anthrax, a Category A agent, has been used for almost a century as an effective <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">biological weapon</term>, as it can be released quietly and discreetly. Anthrax spores are easily available in nature, can be produced in a laboratory, and remain persistent in the environment for a long period. The microscopic spores can be deployed in a powder or spray and can be used to contaminate the air, food, and water supplies. They may be invisible to the naked eye, odorless, and tasteless (CDC, 2020). The German Army used biological agents against enemy countries during World War I, attempting to directly infect animals and contaminate their feed with anthrax (Frischknecht, 2003).</para>
    <para id="para-00006">Anthrax was used in the worst biological attack in U.S. history, known as “Amerithrax” (FBI, n.d.). Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, letters laced with anthrax began circulating through the U.S. Postal Service (USPS), addressed to the offices of U.S. senators and national media outlets in Washington D.C., South Florida, and New York. Opening the letters released anthrax powder into the offices, where it was inhaled, ultimately causing the deaths of five victims and illness in 17 individuals. Panic and fear spread around the country, as it was unknown how many people had come into contact with these letters or how many other letters might be contaminated. This biological attack resulted in one of the largest and most complex law enforcement investigations to date (FBI, n.d.). The costs of human life, emotional distress, and resources were significant. Over 32,000 people exposed to anthrax were required to take prophylactic antibiotics, the USPS purchased 4.8 million masks and 88 million gloves for its employees, and 300 postal facilities were tested for anthrax. The investigation required extensive law enforcement resources. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">Amerithrax Task Force</term> comprised 25 to 30 full-time FBI investigators, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, other law enforcement agencies, and federal prosecutors from the District of Columbia, and the Justice Department’s Counterterrorism Section spent hundreds of thousands of investigative hours on the case. These efforts involved more than 10,000 witness interviews on six different continents, the execution of 80 searches, and the recovery of more than 6,000 items of potential evidence during the investigation. More than 5,750 grand jury subpoenas were issued, and 5,730 environmental samples were collected from 60 sites. These efforts ultimately did not result in a conviction, as the suspect took his own life (FBI, n.d.).</para>

    <title>Identification and Management of Biological Casualties</title>
    <para id="para-00009">Nurses within the community and acute care facilities must be prepared to identify and manage biological casualties. The United States remains vulnerable to bioterrorism. Biological agents like anthrax, botulinum toxin, and bubonic plague can cause a large number of illnesses or deaths in a short amount of time. An attack using a biological agent can mimic a natural outbreak or event, complicating public health assessment and response. Biological agents capable of secondary transmission can lead to epidemics, so early recognition of unusual circumstances is essential in prevention and response (WHO, 2023a).</para>
    <para id="para-00010">The first step in identification is recognizing potential exposure to a biological casualty. Indications of biological agent exposure include (Bland, 2014):</para>
    <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00010">
    <item>Reports of unexplained or unusual symptoms, such as headache, burns, vision problems, chest tightness, difficulty breathing, excessive secretions, nausea, vomiting, convulsions</item>
    <item>Multiple casualties with an unidentified cause</item>
    <item>Unusual taste, smell, or mist</item>
    <item>Unexplained dead animals or plants</item>
    </list>
    <para id="para-00011">Whenever the nurse suspects individual exposure to a biological agent, a thorough assessment should be completed only after ensuring personal safety. For example, the biological agent may have contaminated the individual’s clothing, putting the nurse in danger of exposure. The nurse in this situation should don appropriate PPE, direct the individual to remove contaminated clothing, and follow procedures for decontamination, which include washing with soap and water.</para>
    <para id="para-00012">In the event of biological exposure and contamination, decontamination may be necessary. <term id="term-00006">Biological contamination</term> occurs when infectious agents come into contact with a body surface, inanimate objects, or food or water supplies. <term id="term-00007">Biological decontamination</term> includes disinfection or sterilization of the area to reduce the number of microorganisms to a safe level (<link target-id="table-00002" document="m00355"/>) (Dembeck et al., 2011).</para>

    <title>The Nurse’s Role in Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response</title>
    <para id="para-00017">Nurses are essential members of the public health system. Public health and community health nurses must be prepared for the possibility of terrorist activity at any time. The American Nurses Association (2016) has developed policies, resources, and educational opportunities for nurses on disaster preparedness and acknowledges the importance of preparation so that nurses are equipped to respond to critical events. Nurses have a role in primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention for bioterrorism preparedness and response (<link target-id="table-00004" document="m00355"/>). Refer to <link document="m00167">Pandemics and Infectious Disease Outbreaks</link> for more information on conducting surveillance.</para>

    <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00035">
    <item>Community health nurses are in ideal positions within communities to participate in surveillance. They must be alert to signs of possible terrorist activity, monitoring their communities for specific indicators of possible biologic terrorism, such as unusual numbers of dead or dying animals, unexplained serious illnesses or deaths, atypical vapors or odors in the environment, or unusual swarms of insects that might also indicate the use of biologic agents for terrorism. Diligent surveillance is essential in the early recognition of diseases caused by biological agents. Nurses work collaboratively in partnerships across disciplines for disease surveillance and to communicate vital information via appropriate channels to implement preparedness and response plans (Akins et al., 2005).</item>
    <item>Creating, updating, and implementing a disaster plan is one of the most effective community-based strategies to mitigate injury and mortality from biological attacks. <term id="term-00011">Tabletop exercises</term>, sessions where key individuals who would respond to a disaster discuss their role and response in specific emergency situations, and <term id="term-00012">disaster simulations</term>, where key individuals respond to a specific emergency, simulate the disaster, and respond as if the situation were real, are useful strategies for ensuring that there is a stable response plan and that all team members know their role.</item>

    <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00037">
    <item>Recognition of disease states is key for early intervention during a bioterrorist attack. Nurses may be among the first to recognize the presentation of an unusual illness. The community health nurse must be prepared to act safely, access information rapidly, and use resources effectively (International Council of Nurses, 2019). The community health nurse may be called on to provide direct care to survivors, to serve as a hospital–community liaison, to set up and administer mass immunizations, to support shelters, to make home visits to affected families, to establish a case management system for survivors, or to serve on committees responding to terrorist acts.</item>
    <item>In addition to large numbers of casualties, there may be widespread public panic and fear. The community health nurse must be competent to recognize and respond to the psychological needs of the victims, the public, and the workers responding to a bioterrorism event (International Council of Nurses, 2019).</item>
