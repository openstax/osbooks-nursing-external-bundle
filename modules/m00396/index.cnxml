<title>Antihistamines</title>
<para id="para-00002"><term id="term-00001">Histamine</term><emphasis effect="bold">s</emphasis> are chemicals in the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">immune system</term>. Histamines are released by the body as part of the immune response to a foreign substance such as an allergen or pathogen. Histamine receptors are activated, and reactions occur. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">H1 receptors</term> are found in smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and nerve endings. Activation of these receptors leads to various responses, including smooth muscle contraction, increased vascular permeability, itching, and sensory nerve stimulation. These receptors are involved in allergic reactions as well as regulating sleep–wake cycles and maintaining blood pressure. H2 receptors are mostly located in the stomach parietal cells, regulating gastric acid secretion. When these receptors are blocked, allergy symptoms can be reduced and stomach acid can be controlled.</para>
<para id="para-00003">Once the immune system detects an allergen, a sequence of events is triggered to safeguard the body. Chemical messages are dispatched to mast cells and basophils in various body parts, signaling them to release histamines (see <link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00396"/>). These histamines then augment blood circulation in the vicinity of the allergen, which leads to inflammation. To illustrate, if the nose is impacted, histamines stimulate the mucous membranes to produce additional mucus, resulting in nasal congestion, sneezing, and runny nose. These symptoms can typically be relieved using antihistamines (Fowler, 2022).</para>

<para id="para-00004">In addition to <term id="term-00004">antihistamines</term>, <term id="term-00005">decongestant</term><emphasis effect="bold">s</emphasis> are another class of drugs that are commonly used for short-term relief of nasal congestion, or stuffy nose. A variety of disease processes can cause congestion, including colds, influenza, and allergies. Decongestants come in a wide array of forms including nasal sprays, drops, inhalers, and oral pills. Decongestants work by narrowing blood vessels and decreasing swelling and inflammation, which allows for easier breathing.</para>
<para id="para-00005">Antihistamines play a role in managing allergic reactions and mitigating the symptoms caused by histamine release in the body. The main method of achieving this is by competitively blocking or reducing the effects of histamine on target cellular receptors. Essentially, antihistamines obstruct the receptors in the brain that would typically respond to histamine (Johnson and Johnson, 2023). All three generations of antihistamines are beneficial for allergy relief, anti-inflammatory effects, respiratory symptoms relief, itch relief, and sleep. This chapter will focus on antihistamines as they relate to the respiratory system.</para>
<section id="sect-00003">
<title>First-Generation Antihistamines</title>
<para id="para-00006">Antihistamines belonging to the first generation are extensively accessible and frequently used for managing allergy and cold symptoms. They were among the earliest antihistamines developed. These medications impact the histamine receptors present in the brain and spinal cord. Because they can penetrate the blood–brain barrier, they may lead to drowsiness as a side effect. These antihistamines usually take around 30–60 minutes to take effect and provide relief that lasts for 4–6 hours. A commonly used first-generation antihistamine is diphenhydramine (Sicari &amp; Zabbo, 2023). <link target-id="table-00001" document="m00396"/> lists common <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">first-generation antihistamines</term> and typical routes and dosing for adult clients.</para>

<title>Second-Generation Antihistamines</title>
<para id="para-00010">The mechanism of action and side effects of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">second-generation antihistamines</term> are distinct from those of first-generation antihistamines. Unlike first-generation antihistamines, which block both histaminic and <term id="term-00015">muscarinic</term> receptors and can penetrate the blood–brain barrier, second-generation antihistamines primarily target histamine receptors and do not cross the blood–brain barrier, which therefore diminishes the likelihood of central nervous system–related adverse effects. This distinction leads to a significantly reduced occurrence of first-generation side effects, especially drowsiness, in second-generation antihistamines (Naqvi &amp; Gerriets, 2023).</para>
<section id="sect-00006">
<title>Cetirizine</title>
<para id="para-00011">Initially, cetirizine was a prescription-only second-generation antihistamine, but it was subsequently approved as an over-the-counter (OTC) medication and is now readily accessible. It is a potent treatment for allergic rhinitis and effectively alleviates symptoms such as sneezing, watery eyes, and rhinorrhea. Additionally, cetirizine has been identified as a primary therapeutic option for individuals with chronic <term id="term-00016">urticaria</term>. The effectiveness of cetirizine and its minimal side effects make it a very popular option for clients (Naqvi &amp; Gerriets, 2023).</para>

<title>Third-Generation Antihistamines</title>
<para id="para-00017">The latest type of antihistamines, known as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00023">third-generation antihistamines</term>, are among the newest antihistamines available. They were designed to effectively treat the same conditions as previous antihistamines but without the potential risk of cardiac toxicity that was observed in clients with metabolic issues. This new generation offers a safer alternative for such individuals, and as with the second generation, the likelihood of experiencing negative side effects is decreased. The reduced incidence of side effects is related to the inability of third-generation antihistamines to cross the blood–brain barrier and affect the central nervous system. Second- and third-generation antihistamines are favored compared to the first generation due to their effectiveness and safety profile (Ricciardi et al., 2019).</para>
<para id="para-00018">Fexofenadine is a recently developed third-generation antihistamine (Sakur et al., 2022) for managing allergic rhinitis and chronic urticaria, and it has been approved for use by individuals of all ages, including <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">children</term>. Compared to other antihistamines, fexofenadine has demonstrated greater efficacy in relieving eye and nasal congestion symptoms. Clients who are pregnant or breastfeeding should seek advice from their health care provider before taking this medication because it can decrease breast milk production. It is not usually prescribed during pregnancy. Fexofenadine can cause headaches and dizziness (NHS, 2021).</para>
<para id="para-00019">Desloratadine, an active metabolite of the second-generation antihistamine loratadine, is a highly selective medication that is considerably more powerful than loratadine in treating allergy symptoms and urticaria (DailyMed, <emphasis effect="italics">Loratadine</emphasis>, 2009).</para>

<title>Decongestants</title>
<para id="para-00031"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00030">Decongestant</term>s refer to medications that offer temporary relief for a blocked nose or nasal congestion. They can alleviate the stuffiness commonly associated with allergies, sinusitis, colds, and the flu. These medications function by diminishing the inflammation of the blood vessels in the nose, resulting in opening of the air passage. Two types of decongestants are systemic decongestants and topical, or nasal, decongestants (Corren, 2017).</para>
<section id="sect-00013">
<title>Nasal Decongestants</title>
<para id="para-00032"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00031">Nasal decongestants</term> are typically available as drops or sprays applied directly to the nasal passage. These remedies are regarded as topical agents and do not have any widespread impacts on the body. They are usually favored over oral drugs since they deliver prompt relief from nasal congestion. Nasal decongestants should be used for 3 days or less, as <term id="term-00032">rebound congestion</term> can occur. Rebound congestion is worsened congestion after the medication wears off.</para>
<section id="sect-00014">
<title>Oxymetazoline</title>
<para id="para-00033">Oxymetazoline is a nasal spray that helps alleviate nasal congestion induced by allergies and colds. It may also relieve sinus pressure and congestion. Despite its convenience, this medication should be used only briefly. Overuse, beyond 3 days, can result in rebound congestion, where inflammation of the nasal mucosa occurs due to excessive use of nasal drops or sprays. Oxymetazoline is considered a local decongestant because it acts on the nasal tissue by narrowing the blood vessels and opening the air passages to allow for ease of breathing, producing no systemic effects. The lack of systemic effects can be beneficial to clients with hypertension or other cardiac disorders.</para>

<title>Systemic Decongestants</title>
<para id="para-00036"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00033">Systemic decongestants</term> act by causing vasoconstriction of the nasal mucosa, relieving nasal congestion. Unlike topical nasal decongestants, systemic decongestants can cause more side effects. Nervousness, heart palpitations, insomnia, and tachycardia can be seen. Systemic decongestants act on alpha-adrenergic receptors in the blood vessel walls and can cause an increase in blood pressure and affect the cardiovascular system. Clients with cardiac issues should use systemic decongestants with caution because they can also increase blood pressure.</para>
<section id="sect-00017">
<title>Pseudoephedrine</title>
<para id="para-00037">Pseudoephedrine is a systemic decongestant used to relieve nasal congestion. Pseudoephedrine can be purchased over the counter; however, it is highly regulated due to the use of some components of the drug to make <term id="term-00034">methamphetamine</term>. The drug typically must be requested from the pharmacist, but specific regulations may vary by state (American Addiction Centers, 2023). Clients should avoid caffeine when taking this drug, and those with blood pressure issues should discuss use of this medication with their health care provider. Pseudoephedrine is often found in combination with other medications. Clients should check labels carefully to avoid taking too much of the same medication (MedlinePlus, 2018).</para>
</section>
<section id="sect-00018">
<title>Phenylephrine</title>
<para id="para-00038">Phenylephrine is another common nasal decongestant. This drug is an alpha-adrenergic agonist. It can be administered via tablet, liquid, or dissolving strip. It works as other decongestants do by reducing the swelling of the blood vessels in the nose. As with pseudoephedrine, those with blood pressure issues should consult with their health care provider before taking this medication because it can cause an increase in blood pressure.</para>
