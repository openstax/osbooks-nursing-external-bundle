    <para id="para-00002"><term id="term-00001">Family nursing</term> involves caring for the family as “one client” in the community. Within this specialty, the nurse’s focus moves away from caring for one individual as a client to caring for one unit or group of people as a client. Family health nurses may work in various settings, such as in home care, local government, or hospitals. Family health nurses may work for organizations that focus on family health including the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">National Partnership for Women and Families</term> (2023), which works to improve the lives of families by achieving equality for all women, or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">Families USA</term> (2023), which advocates for high-quality, affordable health care for everyone.</para>
    <para id="para-00003">Working with families is complex but rewarding. Nurses provide families with support and education to achieve desired outcomes. Family health nursing is an integral part of health care delivery. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">International Family Nursing Association</term> (IFNA) works to build a community of nurses and other health care professionals focused on improving families’ health worldwide (IFNA, 2023). Its goal is to transform family health by uniting family nurses across the globe to facilitate networking and knowledge sharing and to provide family nursing leadership through scholarship and research. Recent work by its members includes research on the effects of caregiver-clinician communication on health outcomes and managing family caregiver burden for clients with chronic disease.</para>

    <title>Family Health Affects Individual Health</title>
    <para id="para-00004">Family health reflects the family’s ability to meet each of the individual family members’ needs. Families are expected to help individuals meet their most basic needs for survival, as well as their psychological, spiritual, safety, economic, emotional, and intellectual needs. Many external factors influence the health and well-being of families. Economic stability, access to quality health care and education, safe neighborhoods, and social connections are all conditions that affect families’ ability to function. See <link document="m00140">Social Determinants Affecting Health Outcomes</link> for more information on how social determinants affect individual and family health.</para>

    <title>Characteristics of Healthy Families</title>
    <para id="para-00005">Families can positively or negatively influence one’s health. From a physical perspective, some health conditions are inherited or have risk factors that can be passed from one generation to another. From a social perspective, family relationships become more important as individuals age and may need more assistance with managing health issues. Social support and social connectedness, which can be found in families, positively influence health (CDC, 2023). Marriage is associated with better health and increased likelihood of couples practicing healthy behaviors (Guner et al., 2018). Happily married individuals are healthier and live longer than those who never married or are divorced or widowed, while unhappily married individuals experience fewer benefits and could be considered a vulnerable population (Lawrence et al., 2018).</para>
    <para id="para-00006">Researchers who study families have identified characteristics that can reflect the strength and health of a family (Clark-Jones, 2018):</para>
    <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00002">
    <item>Affection—Strong families show affection or appreciation among members, keep promises to one another, and help others in the family.</item>
    <item>Commitment—Family members who demonstrate loyalty to the family and one another, trust one another, make decisions together, and share responsibilities have strong family ties.</item>
    <item>Positive communication—Family members who communicate regularly and openly in a supportive manner strengthen the family unit.</item>
    <item>Strong coping skills—Strong families are resilient and able to respond effectively to adverse situations.</item>
    <item>Healthy spiritual well-being—Families with strong connections are easily able to share values and beliefs and maintain an overall positive attitude.</item>
    <item>Spending time together—Families who enjoy common interests together including spontaneous activities enjoy a strong family connection.</item>
    </list>
    <para id="para-00007">When working with families, nurses should assess which family attributes can support the families’ health goals. Michaelson et al. (2021) found that family stability and positive parent relationships were health-promoting, while interparental conflict and having an unsupportive family were health-threatening characteristics. Other positive characteristics include having healthy intra-family relationships and communication and encouraging healthy behaviors. The researchers recognized the importance of social determinants of health, specifically socioeconomic background and education. They acknowledged that the research they reviewed incorporated more diverse families than in the past and focused more on how the family functioned instead of what the family looked like. Finally, they concluded children are more likely to be portrayed as passive recipients of health-related behaviors than as active participants in managing their own health.</para>

    <title>Family and Health Promotion</title>
    <para id="para-00011">Community and public health nurses are important providers of health promotion interventions. As discussed in <link document="m00178">Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Strategies</link>, health promotion is the process of empowering people to increase control over, and to improve, their health (World Health Organization [WHO], 1986). The Health Belief Model (HBM), explored in further detail in <link document="m00178">Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Strategies</link>, is a framework nurses can use to help clients recognize their need to modify their health-related behaviors. It is not enough for nurses to provide health-related education to clients. They need to work with clients to get them to take steps toward improving their health.</para>
    <para id="para-00012">Nurses should take a collaborative approach when educating families to help them understand and navigate health issues (Barnes et al., 2020). Nurses can help them improve their decision-making abilities and connect them with community resources including other families that could serve as mentors. Nurses provide education on diseases and disorders, medications, therapies, and a variety of other topics. Incorporating appropriate health promotion strategies into this instruction when working with clients can be beneficial (<link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00336"/>). Nurses can work to strengthen the family’s ability to model positive health practices. This will help children adopt healthy habits and carry that forward through their adult lives (Barnes et al., 2020).</para>

    <para id="para-00013">Education on health promotion, illness prevention, and illness management can occur in various settings—hospitals, clinics, other community locations, or through home visits. Educating families can be challenging, frequently requiring the nurse to accommodate a variety of ages and abilities. An assessment of the clients’ baseline knowledge and any barriers to learning is essential. For a more detailed discussion on health literacy, see <link document="m00187">Assessment, Analysis, and Diagnosis</link>. To learn more about developing an education plan, go to <link document="m00196">Planning Community Health Education</link>.</para>
    <para id="para-00018">Regardless of the setting, the family is key to health promotion (Michaelson et al., 2021). There are four levels of health promotion. The aim of health promotion at the population (family) level is to improve health inequities and overall quality of life and to ensure access to health care (Melariri et al., 2022). <link target-id="table-00001" document="m00336"/> describes the different levels of health promotion in which the community health nurse is involved.</para>

    <title>Role of the Community Health Nurse Conducting Home Visits</title>
    <para id="para-00014">Home nursing involves providing care in the client’s home rather than in a health care setting. Home health visits can be challenging as the nurse is working alone in a home environment rather than a facility. They must have a variety of expertise to deal with complex situations and must work in unpredictable conditions (Brenne et al., 2022). Nurses conducting home visits may face health and safety hazards. They may encounter bloodborne pathogens and ergonomic hazards while moving and lifting clients. Additionally, nurses making home visits may face violence, hostile animals, unhygienic and dangerous conditions, and risks associated with driving from home to home (Occupational Safety and Health Administration, n.d.). Nurses making home health visits need to remain vigilant of their surroundings and recognize potential safety concerns. OSHA has compiled resources for identifying and preventing hazards in home health care; visit <link url="https://openstax.org/r/oshagovh">Home Healthcare</link> to learn more about recognizing and addressing the risks associated with home visits.</para>
    <para id="para-00015">When preparing for the visit, the nurse should review the client’s information and create a plan. Nurses typically make multiple visits during the day, so they must make the most effective use of the short time they spend at each house. Visits consist of an admission visit, usually within 48 hours of discharge from a health care facility, regular visits at prescribed intervals, and a discharge visit. Each visit must have an identified intervention that only a nurse is qualified to perform. Nurses should ensure they take all necessary supplies and understand the directions to the home. Once at the home, the nurse should survey for potential hazards before entering. Nurses should always carry a cell phone and make sure their organization knows their location throughout the day.</para>
    <para id="para-00016">During the visit, the nurse will be in the unique position of being able to assess the client’s home environment. Nurses caring for clients in health care facilities do not have this opportunity, which makes it harder for them to identify factors that can promote or hinder the client’s health and recovery. Next, the nurse will perform the interventions for the visit including education, medication or treatment administration, and wound care. Finally, they will conclude the visit and schedule the next one based on the prescribed frequency and client need or discharge the client. Documentation must be completed either during the visit or soon after.</para>

    <section class="section-summary" id="sect-00007">
    <para id="para-00017">In family health nursing, the nurse focuses on viewing the “client” as one unit or group of people. Family health nurses work in a variety of settings such as home care agencies; local, state, or national agencies or organization; or hospital systems. Family health reflects the family’s ability to meet each family member’s physical, psychological, spiritual, safety, economic, emotional, and intellectual needs. A family’s ability to meet these needs is affected by the SDOH.</para>
