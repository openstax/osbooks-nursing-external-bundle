<para id="para-00002">Newborns, infants, and toddlers include children aged 0 to 3 years. It is important to address health in this age range for several reasons. Children undergo rapid developmental changes in their first years of life. Addressing their health needs helps them reach critical developmental milestones, such as sitting, crawling, and walking. This age group is more susceptible to illnesses and infections than older children due to immature immune systems. Addressing their health needs can help prevent illness or its complications and ensure they receive appropriate medical care. Managing health needs early on can help prevent the later development of chronic health conditions. Additionally, when the nurse provides education that allows caregivers to feel confident in their ability to care for their child, they are better equipped to provide the necessary care and support. Finally, addressing this population's health needs can have broader social and economic benefits. Healthy children are more likely to become healthy adults, leading to a more productive and economically stable society (Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center, 2021; Office of Child Care, n.d.)</para>

<title>National and Global Status of Newborn, Infant, and Toddler Health</title>
<para id="para-00003">Many statistics are gathered regarding newborn, infant, and toddler health. Beyond the infant mortality rate, the United States gathers other data that illustrate the health of this population. The CDC divides data into infants and children up to age 4. According to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS, 2023c), in 2022, 1.5 percent of children in the United States aged 0 to 4 years were in fair or poor health, and 97.5 percent of children in the United States aged 0 to 4 years had a usual place of health care. In 2021, 3,816 deaths occurred in children aged 1 to 4 years, which is 25 deaths per 100,000 (NCHS, 2023b). The leading causes of death in this population were accidents (unintentional injuries); congenital malformations, deformations, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">chromosomal abnormalities</term>; and assault (homicide) (NCHS, 2023c).</para>
<para id="para-00004">Globally, most data are provided for children aged 0 to 5, and various other statistics are used to provide a snapshot of the health of this population. These include the following (World Bank Group, 2023a):</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00002">
<item>Prevalence of anemia: 40 percent (2019)</item>
<item>Prevalence of wasting (low weight for height): 6.8 percent (2021 and 2022)</item>
<item>Prevalence of severe wasting (low weight for height more than 3 standard deviations below the median): 2.1 percent (2022)</item>
<item>Prevalence of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">underweight</term> (low weight for age): 12.3 percent (2022)</item>

<item>Females: 26 deaths per 1,000 live births</item>
</list></item>
</list>
<para id="para-00005">One outlier of the data collection is immunization rates, as this is reported in children aged 12 to 23 months. According to the World Bank Group (2023a), 81 percent of this global population was immunized for diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (DPT) and 82 percent for measles in 2021.</para>
<para id="para-00006">According to the WHO (2023c), in 2018, 5.3 million children under age 5 died, with nearly half of the deaths in sub-Saharan Africa. Globally, this population's leading causes of death are preterm birth complications, pneumonia, birth asphyxia, diarrhea, and malaria (WHO, 2023b). More than half of the deaths in this age group result from diseases that are preventable and treatable through simple and affordable interventions, such as vaccines and adequate nutrition, particularly early and continued breastfeeding. Nutrition-related factors contribute to about 45 percent of deaths in this population (WHO, 2023b). Data regarding immunizations and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">nutrition</term> coverage worldwide can be viewed at the <link url="https://openstax.org/r/platform">Maternal, Newborn, Child, and Adolescent Health and Ageing</link> data portal.</para>

<title>Risk Factors Influencing the Health of Newborns, Infants, and Toddlers</title>
<para id="para-00007">Risk factors for this population are numerous, and the previous section discussed some of them. A lack of prenatal care, the lack of immunizations during pregnancy, and continuing to smoke or use alcohol are some behaviors of the childbearing client that will lead to an increased risk of health problems for their child. At the time of birth, if the delivery does not occur in a health facility with a skilled birth attendant, this is a risk factor. Other risks to child health include not breastfeeding, malnutrition, overcrowded conditions, unsafe drinking water and food, and poor hygiene practices. Finally, a lack of knowledge regarding safety and a lack of identifying and seeking appropriate care for illnesses in this population can lead to poor health outcomes (WHO, 2023b). While these may sound like risk factors for lower socioeconomic income regions, many are risk factors in the United States. Many risk factors for this population are often interconnected and can have cumulative effects on children’s health and development. See <link document="m00140">Social Determinants Affecting Health Outcomes</link> for more risk factors for this population.</para>

<title>Educational Interventions to Promote Care in Newborns, Infants, and Toddlers</title>
<para id="para-00008">Educational interventions focus on this population's parents or caregivers and target preventing their leading causes of death and morbidity and the risk factors previously identified. Nurses play a critical role by providing caregivers with education on preventing unintentional injuries or accidents in this population.

<para id="para-00012">When developing education for toddlers, the nurse should consider their short attention spans and recognize that they cannot understand complex health concepts. Ways to provide simple and interactive education may include songs, games, role-play with dolls or stuffed animals, and storytelling. Separation from parents or caregivers may cause anxiety, so this should also be considered (UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital, 2023a).</para>

<title>Healthy People 2030 Goals for Newborns, Infants, and Toddlers</title>
<para id="para-00013">Childhood, particularly the early years, is a critical period for growth and development. Experiences, behaviors, and health problems can have long-term impacts during the infant and toddler years. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">Healthy People 2030</term> focuses on directly and indirectly improving health, safety, and well-being during this time. These include timely developmental screenings and recommended health services and the development of positive health behaviors, such as getting enough sleep and nutrition, to prevent diseases and injuries. Unfortunately, there are racial/ethnic and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">income disparities</term> in the United States that impact these behaviors. To address these disparities, it is necessary to focus health promotion and prevention strategies on families, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">early childhood education</term> programs, and neighborhoods.</para>

<title>Healthy People 2030 Objectives for Infants and Toddlers</title>
<para id="para-00014"><link url="https://openstax.org/r/infants">Healthy People 2030 Infants Objectives</link> have the overarching goal to “improve the health and safety of infants” (ODPHP, n.d.-c, para. 1). The health of the childbearing client before, during, and after pregnancy strongly impacts their child’s health and well-being through their first year of life. After birth, many of the strategies to promote health include a focus on increasing breastfeeding rates, promoting vaccinations, promoting developmental screenings, encouraging safe sleep practice, and encouraging the correct use of car seats during transportation.</para>

<title>Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Activities to Improve the Health of Newborns, Infants, and Toddlers</title>
<para id="para-00016">Health promotion activities are necessary to improve the health and well-being of this population. The nurse should encourage mothers to breastfeed their newborns exclusively for the first six months of life, as breast milk provides all the necessary nutrients and antibodies for optimal growth and development (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2020). Nurses should also ensure that children in this age group receive all the recommended immunizations to protect against serious infectious diseases and all the recommended screenings to identify health issues early. Various genetic, endocrine, and metabolic disorders; hearing loss; and critical congenital heart defects screenings are provided to newborns before discharge home after a hospital or birthing-center birth (CDC, 2021n). Nurses should encourage caregivers to maintain regular checkups with a health care provider for their child throughout this time frame to monitor their growth and development and address any health concerns or developmental delays.</para>
<para id="para-00017">Nurses should promote safe infant sleep practices to prevent <term id="term-00009">sudden unexpected infant death (SUID)</term>. SUID is the umbrella category that describes all sudden, unexpected infant deaths from known causes, such as injury or accident, and those from unknown causes (Eunice Kennedy Shriver NICHHD, n.d., para. 2). <term id="term-00010">Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)</term> is defined as the sudden death of a baby younger than 1 year of age that does not have a known cause even after full investigation (Eunice Kennedy Shriver NICHHD, n.d., para. 3). About 3,400 babies in the United States die from SUID annually, including those from SIDS, accidental suffocation in a sleeping environment, and other deaths from unknown causes (CDC, 2022h).</para>
<note class="client-teaching" id="note-00003">

</list>
<para id="para-00019">(See CDC, 2022i.)</para>
</note>
<para id="para-00020">Once the child is older and eating solid foods, nurses should encourage caregivers to provide a nutritious diet to promote healthy growth and development. Encourage physical activity to promote motor skills development and reduce the risk of obesity. Promoting oral health includes brushing teeth twice a day and scheduling regular dental checkups. Finally, the nurse should support caregivers in positive mental health practices, such as providing a safe and nurturing environment, fostering positive relationships, and seeking help if needed (CDC, 2022j).</para>
<para id="para-00021">Injury prevention education is imperative to reduce the risk of accidents and injuries in the infant population (CDC, 2022a). The CDC has a variety of fact sheets on safety in the home and community for <link url="https://openstax.org/r/cdcinfants">infants and toddlers</link>.

</list>
<para id="para-00023">A specific type of child abuse is <term id="term-00018">abusive head trauma (AHT)</term>, which includes shaken baby syndrome. AHT is a preventable life-threatening form of physical child abuse that injures an infant’s or child’s brain (National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 2022a), possibly leading to serious brain injury or death. AHT typically occurs when a caregiver shakes or jerks an infant or young child forcefully out of frustration, anger, or the misconception that it will stop the child from crying. Infants' vulnerable neck muscles and large, heavy heads make them particularly susceptible to injury. AHT can happen in a matter of seconds, even with seemingly minor force. Injuries that can result from AHT include subdural hematomas (bleeding between the brain and its protective coverings), diffuse axonal injury (widespread damage to nerve fibers in the brain, disrupting communication between brain cells), retinal hemorrhages (bleeding in the retina, which lines the back of the eye), cerebral edema (swelling of the brain), and/or skull fractures. These injuries can lead to long-term consequences such as developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, seizures, and even death.</para>
<para id="para-00024">Preventing AHT requires a multifaceted approach involving education, awareness, and support. Nurses should identify at-risk families and provide appropriate intervention and support services, including information about the dangers of shaking infants and alternative strategies for soothing a crying baby. Offering resources and support for caregivers, including <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">stress management</term> techniques, counseling services, and parenting classes, can help reduce frustration and improve <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020">coping mechanisms</term>. It is mandatory that any suspected case of child abuse is reported to the appropriate services (National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 2022a).</para>
<para id="para-00025">A variety of information for caregivers of infants and toddlers (aged 0 to 3) can be located on the CDC (2022a) <link url="https://openstax.org/r/cdcparents">Parent Information website</link>. This website discusses the above topics in greater detail and provides schedules for developmental milestones, growth charts, and immunizations.</para>
<para id="para-00026">In addition to strategies to prevent congenital disorders and prenatal infections discussed in <link document="m00322">Section 26.2</link>, other newborn concerns include jaundice and vitamin K deficiency. As the child moves out of the newborn stage, other diseases and conditions, such as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00021">developmental delays</term>, developmental disabilities, and infections are a concern. Nurses should educate caregivers on how to prevent or detect these diseases and conditions early to mitigate complications (CDC, 2022f).</para>
<para id="para-00027">A child with a developmental delay has not gained the skills or reached milestones that experts expect from children their age. Most developmental delays will resolve independently over time (Cleveland Clinic, 2023b). Examples may include delays in rolling over, sitting up, crawling, and walking; trouble with fine motor skills; difficulty understanding or communicating with others; or a lack of age-appropriate social skills. Nurses should encourage caregivers to speak to their pediatrician immediately if they suspect a developmental delay or deviation from expected milestones (CDC, 2022f). Detecting delays early through developmental <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00022">screening</term> can ensure the child has early intervention services, allowing them to catch up to their peers and reach their full potential. A referral to an appropriate health care provider, such as an audiologist, speech therapist, developmental pediatrician, neurologist, physical therapist, occupational therapist, or another provider of early intervention services, may also be necessary. Early intervention is the best way to prevent long-term developmental delays or disabilities. If the child is eligible a care team will develop an <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP)</term> based on the child’s and family’s particular needs.</para>
<para id="para-00028"><term id="term-00025">Developmental disabilities</term> are “a group of conditions due to an impairment in physical, learning, language, or behavior areas, which begin during the developmental period, may impact day-to-day functioning, and usually last throughout the lifetime” (CDC, 2022f, para. 1). They often begin before birth, but some can occur after birth due to injury, infections, or other factors. The cause of some developmental disabilities is unknown. Still, they are believed to be caused by a combination of factors, including genetics, parental health and behaviors during pregnancy, complications during birth, maternal infections during pregnancy, infant infections early in life, and exposure of the mother or child to environmental toxins (CDC, 2022f). About one in six, or 17 percent, of children aged 3 through 17 years have one or more developmental disabilities, according to the CDC (2022f). These occur among all racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups. Examples include <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00026">attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00027">autism spectrum disorder</term>, cerebral palsy, fragile X syndrome, Tourette syndrome, hearing loss, intellectual disabilities, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">learning disabilities</term>, and vision impairment.</para>
<para id="para-00029">Infectious disease prevention in this population is very similar to any infectious disease prevention. Nurses should encourage caregivers to limit visitors during the newborn stage, especially those who are sick. Children younger than 2 are at especially high risk of developing complications from infections such as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), or COVID-19 (CDC, 2022l). Anyone with cold-like symptoms should be taught to avoid close contact follow cough etiquette, wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, and clean frequently touched surfaces. Avoiding infection can prevent complications such as pneumonia, myocarditis, and sepsis.</para>

<title>Primary Prevention</title>
<para id="para-00030"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029">Primary prevention</term> involves taking measures to prevent health problems or injuries before they happen.

Cultural and linguistic diversity itself impacts child development. Language and culture shape a child’s cognitive, social, and emotional development. Because of this, the nurse should understand the importance of building relationships with the child and their caregivers, recognize cultural and linguistic diversity, and value family involvement.</para>
<para id="para-00035">The National Center on Parent, Family, and Community Engagement (2020), part of the HHS Administration for Children and Families, has recently focused on learning how understanding families’ cultural perspectives can help build positive relationships. Nurses who work with families in this way can strengthen family engagement efforts. <term id="term-00033">Family engagement</term> is the process used to build genuine relationships with families to promote strong parent-child relationships, family well-being, and better outcomes. Understanding families’ cultural beliefs, values, and priorities is the key to the family engagement process. The distinct family cultures provide meaning and direction to the lives of children. The various factors influencing families’ cultural beliefs will inform decisions about the child and the family, including health care and education decisions.</para>

<title>Sociocultural Interventions</title>
<para id="para-00041"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00034">Sociocultural interventions</term> for this population should aim to create a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment that recognizes and values the unique background of each child and their family. Before working with this population, nurses should benefit from training in recognizing and respecting applicable cultural differences. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00035">Family-centered care</term> is a specific type of family engagement, described above. Family-centered care involves working collaboratively with families to understand their cultural preferences and needs to provide health care that is sensitive to their beliefs, values, and traditions. This approach may prove helpful when caring for newborns, infants, and toddlers as it promotes shared decision-making and respect between the family and the nurse.</para>
<para id="para-00042">When performing interventions with infants and toddlers, nurses should celebrate diversity. This may involve incorporating clients’ cultures through books, music, art, or other activities. Nurses can adapt <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00036">play-based interventions</term> to various cultures to support children’s cognitive, social, and emotional development. Golsäter et al. (2023) refer to this as “the ability to culturally adjust the health care” (p. 1431).</para>

<title>Linguistically Responsive Interventions</title>
<para id="para-00043">For families who speak languages other than the community's dominant language, providing <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00037">bilingual education</term> and language support can be useful in fostering the child’s development. For example, a nurse could provide materials in the client’s home language and then work with bilingual staff to support communication with the family. Once again, competence training for the nurse, focused on linguistic differences, may help the nurse provide care that is responsive to the unique needs of each child and their family.</para>
<para id="para-00044">Fibla et al. (2022) describe how babies begin to learn and develop language before birth, and for many children, this includes learning multiple languages. By the year 2060, it is estimated that Latino children will constitute one-third of the three-to-four-year-old population, many of whom are <term id="term-00038">dual language learners (DLLs)</term> (Unidos U.S., 2020). DLLs are children learning two or more languages simultaneously or learning a second language while still learning their first language (Head Start, 2023a). The language one speaks is instrumental in forming one's identity, and many bilingual infants with high levels of support for both languages grow to become highly proficient in both (Fibla et al., 2022). Fibla et al. (2022) also described research that found DLLs positively contribute to reading and oral language skills across languages. They recommend the use of linguistically responsive practices to:</para>

<title>Chapter Summary</title>
<para id="para-00045">The early years of a child’s life are crucial for their development. Nurses must understand the risk factors, common health issues, educational needs for caregivers and age-appropriate education for this population. Strategies to support optimal growth and development including immunizations, regular checkups, and nutritional guidance, were emphasized. Early intervention was promoted to address potential health issues, promote healthy behaviors in caregivers, and provide a foundation for lifelong well-being to increase the likelihood of children becoming productive and economically stable adults.</para>
