    <para id="para-00002">The word “disaster” can elicit feelings of anxiety, dread, and fear. While generally considered to be widespread and devastating, a <term id="term-00001">disaster</term> is any occurrence that causes destruction, human injury, or loss that overwhelms the community’s available resources. The number and impact of disasters rise each year. In 2022, 387 disaster events occurred worldwide. These events affected 185 million people, caused 30,704 deaths, and resulted in $223.8 billion U.S. dollars in economic damage (Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters [CRED], 2023). As disasters become more common globally, people are more sensitive than ever to discussions of disasters. Advanced communication methods can instantaneously disseminate news to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">social media</term> outlets, inundating individuals with a constant flow of information and graphic details of the aftermath of disasters. Seemingly “small” incidences may quickly develop into a disaster if resources such as supplies, equipment, personnel, or any other reserves necessary to provide care and recovery during a serious event are unavailable or are depleted quickly. For example, when only one emergency responder arrives without supplies or equipment on the scene of a single car accident with four victims, this could be viewed as a disaster until appropriate resources are dispatched and arrive to assist.</para>
    <para id="para-00003">The public health or community health nurse plays a key role in reducing a disaster’s impact by assisting in assessing a community’s disaster risk, coordinating and participating in preparedness activities, and participating in disaster response/recovery efforts to maximize available resources and minimize loss. A solid disaster prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery plan is key to the community’s ability to emerge stronger and healthier if a disaster occurs.</para>
    <para id="para-00004">Disasters are categorized into two main types: natural and human made. Each type can result in devastating effects on the community, at varying rates and consequences, and has the potential for human, material, economic, or environmental losses with short- or long-term effects on the community.</para>

    <title>Natural Disasters</title>
    <para id="para-00005"><term id="term-00003">Natural disasters</term> are those that arise from forces of nature, such as weather events (hurricanes, tornadoes, snowstorms, heatwaves, lightning, thunderstorms, and droughts), geological events (mudslides, floods, landslides, and avalanches), underground events (tsunamis, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions), or epidemiological events (communicable disease outbreaks or swarms). Some natural disasters occur gradually or can be predicted, allowing communities to prepare for the event. However, many natural disasters occur suddenly and are unpredictable, causing significant public health risks to communities (<link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00354"/>). Destruction and devastation from natural disasters have risen astronomically throughout the world over the past 40 to 50 years (U.N., 2021; White House.gov, 2022). Floods, droughts, severe storms, hurricanes, and heatwaves have caused 80 to 90 percent of all documented natural disasters since 2013 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2023). The WHO (2023) has attributed the number of weather-related natural disasters in recent years to increased weather extremes resulting from climate change. See <link document="m00171">Environmental Health</link> for more information on the effects of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">climate change</term>.</para>

    <caption>On March 11, 2011, a magnitude 9.1 earthquake occurred off the eastern coast of Japan, near the Tōhoku region. The quake was the fourth largest in recorded history and set off a massive tsunami, with some waves estimated to be as much as 133 feet high. The tsunami in turn caused the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster</term>, which involved the meltdown of three of the power plant’s reactors, the release of radioactive water, and the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of residents in what became the exclusion zone. This photo of the tsunami-damaged interior of a seaside recreation facility within the exclusion zone was taken 10 years later. The sheer scope of the disaster complicated emergency response operations and meant that staff, volunteers, and resources were overburdened and had difficulty keeping up with mounting needs. Lack of detailed planning for vulnerable populations, such as elderly and hospitalized clients, resulted in deaths that may have been avoidable.

    <para id="para-00008">Flooding, when excess water overwhelms normally dry land, is the most common natural disaster. Floods may result from heavy rainfall, rapid snowmelt, or a storm surge from a hurricane or tsunami in coastal areas and can cause widespread devastation, loss of life, property damage, and critical <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">public health infrastructure</term> (WHO, 2023b). In 2022 alone, a reported 176 floods affected over 57 million people globally, resulting in more than 7,000 deaths and $44.9 billion U.S. dollars in economic losses (CRED, 2023). There are three common types of floods:</para>
    <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00003">
    <item><term id="term-00007">Flash floods</term> are caused by heavy or excessive rain falling over a short time span, often less than 6 hours. (Flash floods cause raging torrents that raise water levels quickly, sometimes overtaking roads, clearing away everything in their path.)</item>
    <item><term id="term-00008">River floods</term> are caused when excessive rainfall or snowmelt forces a river to exceed capacity. </item>
    <item>Coastal floods are caused by <term id="term-00009">storm surges</term> associated with hurricanes and tsunamis. Storm surge is an abnormal rise of water generated by a storm, over and above the predicted astronomical tides (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA], n.d.-b).</item>
    </list>
    <para id="para-00009">Tornadoes and hurricanes are characterized by high wind speeds and thunderstorms that can produce violent weather conditions, resulting in property destruction. Tornadoes and hurricanes have similar devastating effects, such as high winds and water accumulations from rainfall, but each has its own distinctive dangers (Emergency Planning, 2017). Tornadoes are usually short-lived but have violent rotational winds of 100 to 300 miles per hour that extend from thunderstorms that come into contact with the ground (NOAA, n.d.). Often these storms are visible from miles away but can be hard to see in dark storms that have heavy rains and hail. Hurricanes occur in tropical climates and are typically much larger storms than tornadoes, potentially spanning long periods of time in one area. This increases the rainfall accumulation and makes the area more prone to flooding or storm surges. Winds from hurricanes differ from tornadoes in that they are more sustained winds, from 74 miles per hour and greater, rather than rotational. Based on the speed of the sustained winds, hurricanes are classified on a rating of one to five. The higher the rating, the greater the storm’s potential for damage. While there have been advancements in storm predictions, there is no guarantee of safety in tornadoes, so the threat of tornadoes and hurricane activity should always be taken seriously (NOAA, n.d.-a, n.d.-c). Tornadoes can spawn from hurricanes, thereby increasing the risk of damage to life and property.</para>

    <title>Human-made Disasters</title>
    <para id="para-00010"><term id="term-00010">Human-made disasters</term> are directly caused by people’s actions that devastate and destroy human life. Examples include warfare (acts of terrorism and biological warfare), <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">mass violence</term>, shootings, industrial accidents, and nuclear/radiation incidents. Such disasters can be intentional or accidental, but they are always a result of human activity or neglect that causes damage to or loss of life or property.</para>
    <para id="para-00011">Human-made disasters can be divided into three categories:</para>
    <list list-type="enumerated" number-style="arabic" id="list-00004">
    <item><term id="term-00012">Technological disasters</term>, also known as Natural Hazards Triggering Technological Accidents (<term id="term-00013">NA-TECH</term>) disasters, are technological accidents triggered by natural events. Often, technological accidents are foreseeable and preventable if the associated risks are managed responsibly, and warning signs are not ignored (Krausmann &amp; Necci, 2020). Examples include industrial accidents such as chemical spills, transportation accidents, and mining accidents.</item>

    </list>
    <para id="para-00012">Two well-known technological disasters are the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">Deepwater Horizon</term> oil spill and the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">Chernobyl</term> nuclear accident. Both were avoidable accidents resulting from systematic failures and human neglect. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">morbidity</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">mortality</term> of human and ecological life from both events were high and continue to have long-standing effects.</para>
    <para id="para-00013">The Deepwater Horizon oil spill began with the explosion and sinking of this oil drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010, resulting in the deaths of 11 workers. This disaster also caused the largest offshore oil spill in the history of marine oil drilling operations, with 134 million gallons of oil flowing into the Gulf of Mexico over 87 days (EPA, 2022). The effects of the oil spill spanned 1,300 miles of shoreline along five U.S. states, killing thousands of marine life, birds, and sea turtles and contaminating their natural habitats (NOAA, 2017). This environmental contamination altered the marine ecosystem, thereby reducing the availability and sustainability of a major source of the United States’ seafood supply until the restoration of the ecosystem is complete.</para>
    <para id="para-00014">On April 26, 1986, in a part of the former Soviet Union that is now Ukraine, a nuclear reactor in the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant exploded, causing fires and releasing radioactive material that contaminated the immediate area and many parts of Europe. The disaster resulted from a flawed reactor design operated by inadequately trained personnel. Two Chernobyl plant workers died in the explosion, and 28 people died from acute radiation syndrome within the following weeks. Long-term health effects from the disaster include approximately 5,000 cases of thyroid cancers, 15 of which resulted in fatalities (World Nuclear Association, 2022). Radiation fallout from the disaster was carried by wind and storm patterns over much of the northern hemisphere, although the amounts were insignificant in many cases (International Atomic Energy Agency, 2023).</para>

    <para id="para-00017">Examples of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020">social disasters</term> include warfare and terrorism, such as the Russian invasion and occupation of parts of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00021">Ukraine</term> on February 24, 2022, a major escalation of the Russian-Ukrainian War that began in 2014, and the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00022">Boston Marathon bombing</term> on April 15, 2013. Social disasters, such as these, result in the loss of human life, physical and mental injury, destruction of property, infrastructure, and environment, and damage to the local economy. Social disasters may also give rise to social-political issues and civil unrest, impacting not only the local community but also the national and global community.</para>
    <para id="para-00018">Environmental disasters are the devastation of an area’s ecological system that destroys wildlife and poses a significant threat to humans. Wildfires are one example. In U.S. history, of the 58 wildfires considered the most destructive, almost 28 percent were attributed to arson—fires set intentionally. The community impact of these deliberate acts includes the destruction of 6,500 homes and businesses, 50 fatalities, and the devastation of one million acres of forests (Prell, 2017).</para>

    <title>Public Health and Safety Hazards of Disasters</title>
    <para id="para-00021">Disasters pose significant health and safety risks at the community and individual levels, especially for vulnerable populations. Understanding the breadth and depth of the impact on communities and vulnerable populations requires the consideration of direct and indirect health effects. Risk factors are dynamic and can change based on social and political circumstances surrounding the disaster (Khorram-Manesh &amp; Burkle, 2020).</para>
    <section id="sect-00006">
    <title>Impact of Disasters: Communities</title>
    <para id="para-00022">The direct impact on community health may include large numbers of injuries and deaths that overwhelm the local emergency response services and health systems. Damage to the health services infrastructure, roads and transportation, and communication systems, and reduced resources, such as available health care staff and increased need for additional equipment, can impede health care providers' abilities to care for the number of victims in the immediate response. It also affects the provision of follow-up care, which may have negative consequences for morbidity and mortality in the community. A significant risk of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00023">communicable diseases</term> from a contaminated water supply, deceased animals, standing water, or other environmental factors may exist. Overcrowded health care facilities or living conditions compound the risk of infectious diseases. Food and water shortages pose a significant threat to the population, especially if the community’s location is geographically challenging for responders to access. In addition, the psychological and psychosocial effects of witnessing and surviving catastrophic events may be substantial.</para>
    <para id="para-00023">Indirect impacts on health because of disasters may include disruptions in modes of communication such as telephones, internet connections, and television services. Transportation may become limited due to damaged roads or highway infrastructure and vehicles. Community utilities, including electricity, water, and sewer systems, may be damaged or experience service disruptions.</para>
    <para id="para-00024">Some communities are at greater risk for harm during and following a disaster. Communities with large populations, limited escape routes, population congestion, dense infrastructure, and low socioeconomic status increase community vulnerability (Donner &amp; Rodriquez, 2011). Impoverished communities most often have inadequate infrastructure to withstand a disaster and have disproportionate numbers of vulnerable populations.</para>
    <para id="para-00025">A resilient community has the ability to recover from a disaster and can sustain the community in the face of hardship. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">Social connectedness</term> is an essential characteristic of community resilience (Urban Footprint, 2023). Community members participate in their community, fostering a sense of togetherness and feeling valued. Resilient communities also have social connections that provide emotional and physical support (Urban Footprint, 2023). Local organizations are trusted and provide needed community resources, such as food banks and financial assistance. Strong health care systems and government are prepared for disaster and recovery and have access to resources such as clean water and medical equipment. These communities continuously work on building resilience by improving social connections, ensuring government involvement in disaster management, improving risk communication to the entire community and vulnerable groups, improving community members physical and mental health, and increasing community social and economic health (Urban Footprint, 2023).</para>
    </section>
    <section id="sect-00007">
    <title>Impact of Disasters: Vulnerable Populations</title>
    <para id="para-00026">Vulnerable populations are those with characteristics that affect their capacity to anticipate, respond to, and recover from the impact of disasters. The most <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00025">vulnerable populations</term> are low-income populations, older adults, and ethnic and racial minorities.</para>
    <para id="para-00027">Those of low socioeconomic status are less prepared for disasters (SAMHSA, 2017). This population most often lacks the resources to afford mitigation efforts, such as strengthening household structures and purchasing disaster insurance. Financial resources are most often used for current purchases rather than mitigating and preparing for a potential disaster in the future. Even more vulnerable are people with lower incomes who are experiencing <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00026">homelessness</term>, women, or residents of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00027">public housing</term>, because they often lack finances and resources needed in instances of evacuation (SAMHSA, 2017). These groups are less likely to evacuate prior to a disaster. Following a disaster, low-income populations have greater difficulty obtaining aid, housing loans, food assistance, assistance with evacuation and transportation, and access to medical resources (SAMHSA, 2017; Martin, 2019). Consequences of disaster for low-income populations includes greater instances of homelessness, unemployment, injury, mortality, economic loss, depression, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">posttraumatic stress</term> (SAMHSA, 2017).</para>
    <para id="para-00028">Older adults are more vulnerable to disasters as compared to other age groups (American Red Cross, 2020). Mortality rates within this population following disasters are greater because they have greater prevalence of chronic conditions, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029">comorbidities</term>, cognitive impairment, and medication needs following disasters. A greater number of older adults are dependent on assistive devices and caregiver support and are socially isolated.</para>
    <note class="health-alert" id="note-00004">
    <title>Spotlighting health disparities in the face of disaster: The Risk Project</title>
    <para id="para-00029">Natural disasters disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, such as low-income or racial or ethnic minority groups. These groups are more likely to live in areas at high risk for natural disasters and in housing that pose safety risks when disasters occur. The Resilience in Survivors of Katrina (RISK) Project began as a research study in New Orleans, Louisiana, to examine the effects of economic and academic support on the retention of community college students. Over a 15-year period (2003-2018), researchers studied 1,019 parents who were low-income and primarily Black. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina disrupted the study, as many participants were hurricane victims. As a result, the study became the RISK Project, focusing on the effects and consequences of a disaster on vulnerable populations.</para>
    <para id="para-00030">The results of the RISK Project have health policy implications for improving the quality of health for vulnerable populations and racial/ethnic minorities. The study found barriers to evacuation and care and a lack of long-term mental health services led to poorer health and psychosocial effects on individuals affected by disasters.</para>

    <title>Assessment of Disaster or Public Health Emergency Risk</title>
    <para id="para-00033">Beverly, the nurse described at the beginning of this chapter, conducted a community assessment to identify the needs of vulnerable populations within the community in the event of a hurricane. This assessment contributed to a larger assessment of the community disaster and public health emergency risk that assists the community in meeting the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00030">National Preparedness Goal</term>, which outlines what entire communities need to prepare for different emergencies. The National Preparedness Goal is “a secure and resilient Nation with the capabilities required across the whole community to prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover from the threats and hazards that pose the greatest risk” (Homeland Security, 2018). Community disaster and public health emergency risk assessment provides information for communities to plan for, protect, respond to, and recover from hazards.</para>
    <para id="para-00034">Many frameworks are available to guide disaster risk assessment. For example, the <link url="https://openstax.org/r/femagovsi">Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment</link> (THIRA) (FEMA, 2023) guides communities to identify:</para>
    <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00008">

    <para id="para-00035">Communities use multiple resources, such as previous experience, existing hazard assessments, organizational and business risk assessments, and new data, to identify potential natural, technological, and human-caused hazards (FEMA/Homeland Security, 2018). The process begins by determining the likelihood and impact of the hazard. The community then identifies the effect of the location, magnitude, and time of the hazard. Finally, the current capability of the community to handle the hazard and target or goal for capability is determined. The gap between the current and target goal for capability directs the community to plan to decrease the gap.</para>

    <para id="para-00037">Communities may use several tools, databases, and sources to complete disaster risk assessment. For example, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00038">Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)</term> manages <link url="https://openstax.org/r/hazardsfe">The National Risk Index</link>, that can be used to identify potential natural hazards within a community. It maps 18 natural hazards that impact the United States and identifies those most at risk. The Risk Index identifies potential natural hazards and ranks communities based on expected annual loss, social vulnerability, and community resilience. A community is compared to others and ranked by percentile: the higher the percentile, the greater the risk compared to other communities.</para>

    <para id="para-00040">The <link url="https://openstax.org/r/femagovsite">Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (THIRA) and Stakeholder Preparedness Review (SPR) Guide</link> helps communities identify possible hazards to prepare ahead and increase capabilities in case of a disaster. It is recommended that the assessment be completed every three years using a collaborative community approach (FEMA/Homeland Security, 2018).</para>
    <para id="para-00041">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00040">Social Vulnerability Index (SVI)</term> database is used to locate the most socially vulnerable populations within a community by census tract (Flanagan et al., 2018). SVI categories of vulnerability include socioeconomic status, household composition and disability, minority status and language, and housing and transportation. These vulnerability factors influence an individual’s and community’s capability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from disaster (Flanagan et al., 2018). This assists communities in identifying areas in the community that may require additional assistance with disaster management.</para>
