<para id="para-00002">Obesity is a global concern that may not be managed by diet and exercise alone. There are other adjunct medications and supplements that can promote weight loss in conjunction with diet and exercise.</para>

<title><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) Receptor Agonists</term></title>
<para id="para-00003">GLP-1 receptor agonist medications were originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes and control blood sugar; however, they have been found to also cause weight loss and decrease the risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes in clients with diabetes.</para>
<section id="sect-00004">
<title>Semaglutide</title>
<para id="para-00004">Semaglutide, which mimics the GLP-1 hormone that is released in the gut in response to eating, is the newest medication for weight management. Semaglutide is approved for weight loss only under the brand name Wegovy. Semaglutide is also the active ingredient in several medications used to treat diabetes (Ozempic, Rybelsus). However, due to differing doses and differences in how the drug is packaged, prescribers should take caution when prescribing off-label.</para>
<para id="para-00005">Semaglutide is intended for use in adults with an initial BMI of 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or greater (obesity) or an initial BMI of 27 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or greater (overweight) and at least one weight-related comorbidity such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or dyslipidemia (DailyMed, <emphasis effect="italics">Wegovy</emphasis>, 2023). Semaglutide may be used in pediatric clients over age 12 who have an initial BMI at or above the 95th percentile for their age and sex. According to UCLA Health (2023), semaglutide emphasizes treating obesity as a chronic metabolic disease rather than solely a condition that requires lifestyle/behavioral changes.</para>
<note class="trending-today" id="note-00001">
<para id="para-00006"><emphasis effect="bold">Weight Loss Benefits with Semaglutide</emphasis></para>
<para id="para-00007">Losing weight can positively affect many body systems, especially the cardiovascular system; however, semaglutide itself may also have cardiovascular benefits. A <link url="https://openstax.org/r/nbcnews">report by NBC News</link> discusses a potential reduction of cardioembolic events such as a myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident (stroke) in those taking semaglutide.</para>
</note>
<para id="para-00008">When the blood glucose levels rise in response to ingested food, semaglutide mimics the GLP-1 hormone to stimulate insulin release and decrease glucagon release. This action lowers serum glucose levels and delays gastric emptying. A decrease in blood glucose and delayed gastric emptying suppress the appetite, which aids in weight loss. Note that because semaglutide delays gastric emptying, it may alter the absorption of other medications and supplements.</para>
</section>
<section id="sect-00005">
<title>Liraglutide</title>
<para id="para-00009">Liraglutide has been shown to be an effective treatment to reduce weight in clients who are obese. Liraglutide is an injectable medication classified as a glucagon-like peptide receptor agonist and incretin mimetic that triggers increased insulin release and decreased glucagon release, lowering post-prandial blood glucose levels. By causing a glucose-dependent release of insulin and a decrease in blood glucagon levels, there is a delay in gastric emptying, leading to appetite suppression and weight loss. This action also causes an ancillary increase in heart rate of 10–20 beats per minute above the client’s baseline.</para>
<para id="para-00010">Liraglutide is highly bound to protein, has a large distribution area, and has a half-life of approximately 13 hours. This allows for a once-a-day subcutaneous (SQ) injection (abdomen, thigh, upper arm) without regard to meals to be effective. Double gloves and a protective gown (and goggles if necessary) should be worn during preparation and SQ administration to avoid unintentional absorption through the skin. Liraglutide has caused thyroid C-cell tumors in mice (DailyMed, <emphasis effect="italics">Saxenda,</emphasis> 2021).</para>

<section id="sect-00009">
<title>Bupropion Naltrexone</title>
<para id="para-00019"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">Bupropion naltrexone</term> (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">Contrave</term>) is a combination of an <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">antidepressant</term> (bupropion) and an <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">opioid antagonist</term> (naltrexone). Bupropion is commonly used for adult depression, seasonal affective disorder (SAD), and smoking cessation. Naltrexone is commonly used for substance abuse disorders because it blocks opioid receptors and the euphoric effects of alcohol and opioids. In combination, these two drugs have been found to promote weight loss as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor by affecting two different areas of the brain involved in hunger and satiety stimuli—the hypothalamic appetite regulatory center and the mesolimbic dopamine circuit reward system. The resultant decreased appetite results in therapeutic weight loss.</para>
<para id="para-00020">Bupropion naltrexone is indicated for chronically overweight clients or those with chronic obesity with at least one other comorbidity (hypertension, type 2 diabetes, or dyslipidemia). This drug is used as an adjunct to a low-calorie diet and increased exercise in clients with obesity. Both drugs are well-absorbed orally, and a low-fat meal enhances absorption.</para>
<section id="sect-00010">
<title>Adverse Effects and Contraindications</title>
<para id="para-00021">Adverse effects of bupropion naltrexone include life-threatening anaphylactic reactions (pruritis, urticaria, hives, dyspnea, angioedema), homicidal/suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and seizures. Common adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, constipation, and headache. Clients should be instructed to contact their provider immediately if any abnormal symptoms occur. Clients with diabetes should monitor capillary blood glucose levels 3–4 times per day for hypoglycemia caused by the drug and/or weight loss.</para>
<para id="para-00022">Contraindications include a known hypersensitivity to bupropion or naltrexone, uncontrolled hypertension, end-stage renal disease, severe hepatic impairment and concurrent use of CYP2B6 inducers, seizure disorders, anorexia or bulimia, pregnancy, and in children. Concurrent use is contraindicated within 14 days of the use of an MAOI, or use of opioids or other bupropion medications and antidepressants including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Bupropion naltrexone should be used cautiously in older adults secondary to possible adverse CNS effects and decreased renal excretion. Dosages are often decreased in cases of renal and hepatic impairment. Use of other bupropion-containing products may increase the risk of seizures. Bulimia and anorexia nervosa may also increase the risk of seizures.</para>

<title>Supplements and Herbal Remedies for Weight Management</title>
<para id="para-00026"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">Supplements</term> such as chromium picolinate, conjugate linoleic acid, glucomannan, green tea extract, guarana, and hoodia have been credited with supporting weight loss. The success of these supplements, just like drugs, relies on their being adjuvant to low-calorie meals and exercise. A successful weight-management plan is individualized and client centered and may include natural food or herbal supplements to aid in weight loss. Stress-reduction techniques also play a role in lowering cortisol levels and improving mental well-being, because stress may impede weight-loss success.</para>
<section id="sect-00013">
<title>Chromium Picolinate</title>
<para id="para-00027">Chromium is an essential mineral involved in glucose metabolism and is often called glucose tolerance factor (GTF). It is found in various foods such as beef, chicken, eggs, dairy products, broccoli, potatoes, and garlic, but it is poorly absorbed, prompting some clients to use supplements. Picolinate acid, an amino acid, is added to chromium to improve the absorption and aid insulin function. However, excessive supplementation can lead to toxicity. Research indicates that <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">chromium picolinate</term> can lower blood glucose and serum cholesterol, promote fat loss, and increase lean muscle mass, especially in clients with type 2 diabetes. Clients who are dependent on insulin should use it under medical guidance and monitor their capillary blood glucose levels (Balch, 2023).</para>

<title>Conjugated Linoleic Acid</title>
<para id="para-00028"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA)</term> is a polyunsaturated fatty acid found naturally in animal food products such as beef, lamb, butter, and dairy products. Synthetic CLA may be produced from safflower, sunflower, corn, and soybean oils. This essential fatty acid has been found to have antiobesogenic and antiatherosclerotic properties (den Hartigh, 2019). The metabolic mechanism of action of CLA reduces lipogenesis while promoting lipolysis to improve body composition. Studies have found that CLA increases lipolysis significantly in human fat cells (adipocytes) while decreasing the synthesis of fatty acids (Basak &amp; Duttaroy, 2020). The use of CLA may interfere with CYP enzyme functions. It may also interfere with the effectiveness of tamoxifen, a breast cancer medication.</para>

<section id="sect-00015">
<title>Glucomannan</title>
<para id="para-00029">Processed foods have removed much of the natural fiber in the American diet. Fiber supplements are often used for overall health and wellness. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">Glucomannan</term> is a dietary fiber extracted from the konjac (elephant yam), a Japanese root vegetable. Glucomannan passes unchanged into the colon, where it works as a dietary fiber. It is one of the most potent fibers because it can absorb up to 50 times its weight in water; therefore, a smaller amount is taken than for other fiber supplements.</para>
<para id="para-00030">Some research has shown that supplementing with glucomannan may reduce body weight but not BMI in the short term in otherwise healthy adults with overweight or obesity. Other research has shown that daily 4-gram doses of glucomannan consumed over 8 weeks did not lead to weight loss or changes in body composition, feelings of hunger or meal satiation, or impact cholesterol or blood sugar levels (MacPherson, 2022).</para>
<para id="para-00031">Glucomannan reduces weight in the same way as other water-soluble, fermentable fibers do—through low energy density and bulking properties causing a laxative effect. The absorption of water expands glucomannan in the gastrointestinal tract, producing satiety. Additionally, glucomannan, like all fiber foods, stabilizes blood glucose levels and reduces total cholesterol and LDL levels through fecal excretion. As with all fiber supplements, adequate water intake is essential to avoid constipation.</para>

<section id="sect-00016">
<title><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">Green Tea Extract</term></title>
<para id="para-00032">Second to water, tea is the most consumed beverage globally. Green tea is one of the healthiest teas available for consumption. Green tea contains polyphenols and phytochemicals with antioxidant and antiviral properties. The health-enhancing properties of green tea are numerous. One of the polyphenols in green tea helps protect the DNA in the body’s cells from oxidative stress. This boosts the body’s immune system to combat many conditions and illnesses, including cancer. A study in South Korea found that consistently drinking green tea reduced abdominal obesity by 44% (Kwak &amp; Shin, 2022).</para>
<para id="para-00033">The natural pharmacological effects of green tea are related to the increased fatty acid oxidation that reduces body and abdominal fat. Additionally, green tea lowers concentrations of total cholesterol, serum free fatty acids, and leptin levels. These effects may decrease the incidence of metabolic syndrome.</para>

<title>Guarana</title>
<para id="para-00034"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">Guarana</term> is a seed with stimulant and phytochemical properties containing caffeine as the active ingredient. It is used as a general intestinal detoxification herb and stimulant to improve mental alertness and increase metabolic rate. Guarana is rich in antioxidants and is like green tea in its properties. Consumers can find guarana in energy drinks, soft drinks, smoking-cessation products, and vitamin supplements. Guarana alone does not significantly promote weight loss; it must be combined with a low-calorie diet and exercise. Due to the stimulant effects, guarana should not be used by clients with hypertension or cardiovascular conditions such as dysrhythmias. A disadvantage for consumers is that it is not easy to determine how much caffeine content any specific product contains.</para>

<title>Chapter Summary</title>
<para id="para-00043">This chapter discussed the differences between overweight and obesity and their pathophysiology. Clinical manifestations were also explained. A variety of pharmacological methods of weight management were discussed, including anorexiants, lipase inhibitors, and other drugs. The chapter also described various supplements and herbal remedies for weight loss.</para>
<para id="para-00044">Despite the availability of OTC and prescribed weight-loss drugs and supplements, the chapter discussed how the best strategy for weight loss is lifestyle modifications, such as exercise and caloric restriction, as a proven effective treatment in obesity. However, lifestyle modifications do not always promote optimal weight loss. Often supplements and/or medications are required. Once a healthy weight is achieved, clients must continue to practice healthy habits to maintain weight management.</para>
