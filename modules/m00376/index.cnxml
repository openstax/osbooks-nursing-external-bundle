    <para id="para-00001">Nurse scholars have developed theories of nursing to define the profession and guide data collection and interpretation using a structured approach. The use of theory when planning nursing care guides the nurse in planning effective interventions and connects theory to nursing practice and research. Historically, many nurse theorists sought an individual approach to change. Theorists in public health take a broader approach, including the social, economic, and environmental factors that impact the development of health problems at the population, community, or family levels. For example, when planning care for a community that treats a high percentage of children with asthma in the local school systems, an individual approach would include specific medications to treat symptoms and planning for self-care. However, a broader perspective may consider how symptoms may be linked to environmental factors, such as allergens or irritants, as well as the quality of housing (e.g., the presence of pet dander, rugs, food additives, cigarette or cigar smoke, fragrances, temperature, humidity, dust mites or cockroaches, or air pollution).</para>

    <title>C.1 Relevance of Theories and Models</title>
    <para id="para-00002">Population health nurses use theory to plan and implement care at the family, local, regional, or national level. For example, a public health nurse may work within a local community to assess a virus outbreak in a school, while a nurse epidemiologist might assess a communicable disease incidence in a larger population. This section reviews a sample of nursing theories related to the individual, family, community, and population levels of care.</para>

    <title>C.2 Nursing Theories at the Individual Level</title>
    <para id="para-00003">While community-based models generally focus on the family, community, and population levels of care, serious illness care programs are often driven by the goals and priorities of the person directly affected and their family. Therefore, <link target-id="table-00001" document="m00376"/> in this section includes individual-level theories. Services should be culturally and linguistically responsive, and careful attention must be paid to social risks such as poverty, mental illness, insecure housing, food, and transportation, which create unique challenges, as do past or present traumatic events. Comprehensive assessments at the individual level offer insight into collaboration with colleagues and community partners.</para>

    <entry valign="top" align="left">
    Nursing's primary concern is to define the appropriate action in situations that are stress-related or concerning possible reactions of the client or client system to stressors. Nursing interventions aim to help the system adapt or adjust and retain, restore, or maintain some degree of stability between the client system variables and environmental stressors, focusing on conserving energy.

    A nurse struggled with the demands of working in an inner-city emergency department following treating clients who were involved in a mass shooting. One of the clients that the emergency room treated that day was a young member of the nurse’s suburban community who unfortunately passed away due to the injuries sustained. The nurse spoke with the nurse manager and obtained mental health services and was granted time away from work to rest and recover from the trauma. The nurse subsequently returned to work with a renewed perspective of service and commitment to the many members of the community that are effectively treated annually in the emergency department.

Several years later, this same nurse completed a doctoral degree and became the director of a bachelor's degree program. Given this experience, the nurse was asked to consult with a local university and community health partners to develop a successful Bachelor of Science Nursing program and obtained a grant to assist students with tuition and other support resources.</entry>
