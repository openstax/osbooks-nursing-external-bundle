    <para id="para-00002"><term id="term-00001">Recruitment</term> and <term id="term-00002">retention</term> of program participants is one of the most important components when planning for implementation because no matter how well a program is planned, it will not successfully meet goals with little or no participation. Recruitment is finding community members from the target population to participate in a community health program. Retention is continued participation in a community health program until its completion. To successfully recruit and retain participants, the program team must develop strategies that utilize evidence from the literature, previous experience with recruitment and retention, and knowledge of the target population's values and beliefs. While several recruitment and retention strategies have been proven to be effective, a combination of strategies is needed to achieve the greatest success (Rural Health Information Hub [RHIhub], 2018b). <link target-id="table-00001" document="m00202"/> provides a description of recruitment strategies and tasks to complete each strategy.</para>

    <para id="para-00009">Barnes-Prosby et al. (2017) provide a <link url="https://openstax.org/r/rand">toolkit</link> for the program team to enhance participant recruitment and retention. The toolkit includes five strategies, applicable activities, and examples to guide recruitment and retention planning.</para>

    <title>Population Considerations: Health Care Providers</title>
    <para id="para-00010">Some community health programs utilize <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">health care providers (HCPs)</term> to deliver interventions and assist with program planning, participant recruitment and program evaluation. For example, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">community health workers (CHWs)</term> are public health workers who liaise between health services and the community to improve access to services (Carter et al., 2016). One method to promote CHWs and link clients to them is to have HCPs refer their clients to or write prescriptions for a CHW. In these circumstances, the program team considers the recruitment and retention of HCPs and clients.</para>
    <para id="para-00011">Multiple factors influence HCP participation. The program team designs strategies to enhance their recruitment and retention and reduce barriers to their participation. For example, HCPs are more likely to participate in community health programs when they understand the program's value for themselves and their clients, the burden of performing the intervention is low, and the provider's needs match community needs that are met by an evidence-based interventions (Krebs et al., 2021). Conversely, the HCP may be less likely to participate when they lack knowledge and training before program implementation, are inexperienced with client recruitment, have inadequate communication with the program team, and lack time to perform interventions (Krebs et al., 2021).</para>
    <para id="para-00012">To successfully recruit and retain HCPs, Krebs et al. (2021) recommend including health care providers in all levels of planning, developing a recruitment strategy at the beginning of the planning process, training HCPs on how to recruit clients and implement the intervention, and using frequent, clear, goal-oriented communication throughout the program.</para>
