    <para id="para-00002">Diarrhea involves frequent, loose, watery stools. Diarrhea can be acute (lasting 1–2 days, often due to microorganisms, viruses, or food intolerance) or chronic (lasting weeks, indicating underlying conditions like IBS or Crohn's disease) (Johns Hopkins Medicine, 2023). Symptoms may include abdominal distress, cramping, bloating, nausea, and urgency. Dehydration is a serious concern, and bloody stools should be reported. <term id="term-00001">Antidiarrheal</term> treatments aim to slow intestinal motility, but they should not be taken if signs of infection (fever, severe pain, bloody/mucus stool) are present, as they could allow pathogens to multiply. In these cases, it is important to contact the health care provider.</para>

    <title>Acute versus Chronic Diarrhea</title>
    <para id="para-00003">Diarrhea is one of the most common complaints in the United States. Although the diarrheal stools of chronic versus acute diarrhea may appear similar, it is important to understand the different causes and complications of these two medical conditions. Read this <link url="https://openstax.org/r/giorgtopics">online article from the American College of Gastroenterology</link> to learn more.</para>

       <section id="sect-00003">
    <title><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">Opioid-Related Antidiarrheal Medications</term></title>
    <para id="para-00004">Opioid-related antidiarrheal medications activate opioid Mu-receptors in the GI tract to slow intestinal motility, allowing more time for absorption of fluid and electrolytes by the colonic mucosal. Identifying the underlying cause of the diarrhea is recommended before treating it with an antidiarrheal agent. Caution should be exercised with opioid-related antidiarrheals because, if taken at high doses, clients may experience the typical opioid effects of euphoria or CNS depression. See <link target-id="table-00001" document="m00422"/>.</para>
    <section id="sect-00004">
    <title>Diphenoxylate with Atropine Sulfate</title>
    <para id="para-00005">Diphenoxylate is a synthetic narcotic that reduces intestinal movement by targeting opioid receptors, effectively stopping diarrhea. It also slightly reduces fluid and electrolyte secretion in the intestines, promoting drug absorption. However, unlike typical opioids, it lacks analgesic effects and does not affect the central nervous system (CNS) at recommended doses for diarrhea. However, when used at higher doses or over an extended period, it can lead to euphoria, sedation, and addiction, classifying it as a Schedule II drug under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) when prescribed alone (National Library of Medicine, 2022). When combined with atropine sulfate, it produces anticholinergic side effects when higher doses are used and is classified as a Schedule V drug.</para>
    <para id="para-00006">To prevent abuse, low doses of atropine, an anticholinergic, are added to diphenoxylate. Although this combination effectively manages diarrhea, atropine can lead to unpleasant side effects such as blurred vision, urinary retention, dry mouth, constipation, and tachycardia. The addition of atropine counteracts the potential euphoria from diphenoxylate, making the combination a Schedule V drug under the CSA. See <link target-id="table-00002" document="m00422"/> for additional information on diphenoxylate with atropine sulfate.</para>
    </section>
    <section id="sect-00005">
    <title>Loperamide</title>
    <para id="para-00007">Loperamide is an effective antidiarrheal agent that prolongs transit time in the colon by directly inhibiting the peristatic activity of the circular and longitudinal muscles of the intestine, thereby decreasing intestinal fluid secretion into the intestinal lumen. This helps to increase the absorption of water and electrolytes in the intestines, resulting in firmer stools and a reduction in diarrhea.</para>
    <para id="para-00008">Loperamide is often used for the symptoms of acute diarrhea, such as traveler’s diarrhea or viral gastroenteritis. It can also be used to manage chronic diarrhea associated with conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome.</para>
    <note class="clinical-tip" id="note-00002">
    <title>Dehydration</title>
    <para id="para-00009">When administering antidiarrheals, the nurse should assess the client for signs and symptoms of dehydration by checking daily weights, skin turgor, and vital signs.</para>

    <title>Adjuvant Antidiarrheals</title>
    <para id="para-00010">Many clients experience diarrhea secondary to chemotherapeutic agents. Chemotherapy targets rapidly dividing cancer cells. However, chemotherapy often affects the cells within the gastrointestinal tract. Diarrhea caused by chemotherapy is referred to as chemotherapy-related diarrhea (CRD). Adjuvant antidiarrheals are often used for CRD to slow and manage the diarrhea (Krishnamurthi &amp; Macaron, 2022). See <link target-id="table-00001" document="m00422"/>.</para>
    <section id="sect-00007">
    <title>Bismuth Subsalicylate</title>
    <para id="para-00011">Bismuth subsalicylate (BSS) is an insoluble salt of salicylic acid and trivalent bismuth antidiarrheal that inhibits the synthesis of prostaglandins and cyclooxygenase that are responsible for inflammation and gastrointestinal motility. Bismuth subsalicylate works directly on the intestinal mucosa as a protective agent, decreasing intestinal secretions, and possesses anti-infective properties for acute diarrhea. However, pending the suspicious organisms, targeted anti-infective therapy may be necessary.</para>
    <para id="para-00012">BSS is commonly used for traveler’s diarrhea. It can also provide temporary relief for dyspepsia and is sometimes part of <emphasis effect="italics">Helicobacter pylori</emphasis> (<emphasis effect="italics">H. pylori</emphasis>) treatment alongside a proton pump inhibitor, tetracycline, and metronidazole due to its anti-inflammatory effects. BSS is available in various forms for oral administration. Chewable tablets should be crushed and taken with water. Shake liquid suspensions well before use.</para>
    </section>
    <section id="sect-00008">
    <title>Octreotide</title>
    <para id="para-00013">Octreotide is a somatostatin analog primarily used for hyperpituitarism disorders, such as acromegaly. However, octreotide is an adjuvant antidiarrheal to treat several severe diarrheal conditions associated with carcinoid tumors, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) tumors, gastrin-secreting tumors, and short bowel syndrome (Novartis, 2021). Octreotide is recommended for clients with CRD that does not respond to loperamide (Krishnamurthi &amp; Macaron, 2022).</para>
    <para id="para-00014">This long-acting octapeptide mimics somatostatin and suppresses the secretion of various hormones and peptides. Octreotide promotes fluid and electrolyte absorption in the GI tract, slowing down intestinal transit time.</para>
    <para id="para-00015">Octreotide is available in capsule form for oral administration and as a parenteral solution for subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intravenous administration (DailyMed, <emphasis effect="italics">Octreotide acetate,</emphasis> 2023). The oral route is not indicated for the treatment of diarrhea (DailyMed, <emphasis effect="italics">Mycapssa,</emphasis> 2023). Clients who have responded well to octreotide injections may switch to intramuscular depot injections (i.e., in the buttocks), avoiding the deltoid muscle due to potential discomfort at the injection site (Novartis, 2021).</para>

    <section id="sect-00009">
    <title>Pancreatin</title>
    <para id="para-00016">Pancreatin, a medication containing porcine digestive enzymes, is used when the pancreas cannot produce essential enzymes (lipase, amylase, and protease) that are required for proper digestion of fats, carbohydrates, and proteins. Incomplete digestion occurs with deficient pancreatic enzyme levels and may cause excessive diarrhea. Pancreatic enzymes are sometimes used as a secondary treatment in conditions with excessive diarrhea.</para>
    <para id="para-00017">Pancreatin is an oral medication available by prescription as a tablet or capsule or over the counter as a dietary supplement. As a digestive enzyme, pancreatin is always taken with food and with a full glass of water. Pancreatin should be immediately swallowed whole to avoid irritation to the oral mucosa. It cannot be crushed or chewed. To be effective, pancreatin must be taken consistently for the best results.</para>
