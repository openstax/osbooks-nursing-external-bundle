<title>Creating a Welcoming Environment</title>
<para id="para-00007">A welcoming environment in health care refers to a setting that is inclusive, respectful, and culturally sensitive to clients from diverse backgrounds. Such an environment promotes <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">client-centered care</term> and is culturally responsive to clients’ diverse needs—a place where clients feel respected, valued, and included, regardless of their cultural or linguistic backgrounds. By creating a welcoming environment, health care workers can improve the quality of care and promote positive health outcomes for all clients (<link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00222"/>).

<title>Communicating Effectively Across Cultures</title>
<para id="para-00011">Trust provides the foundation for effective communication with clients. Building trust is essential because it lays the groundwork for a strong therapeutic relationship between health care providers and their clients from different backgrounds. When clients trust their health care providers, they are more likely to openly share their concerns, beliefs, and preferences, which enhances diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. In a culturally diverse health care setting, trust helps overcome potential language and cultural barriers that may otherwise hinder effective communication. By fostering trust, nurses can create an environment where clients feel safe, respected, and valued. Additionally, trust plays a significant role in ensuring client compliance and adherence to treatment plans. Clients are more likely to follow treatment recommendations from health care providers they trust, leading to improved health outcomes.</para>
<para id="para-00012">To build trust, nurses need to demonstrate <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">cultural humility</term>, which involves acknowledging their own <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">biases</term>, being open to learning about different cultures, and actively engaging in respectful and nonjudgmental communication. Nurses should prioritize active listening, empathy, and validating clients’ experiences and perspectives. Additionally, they should be sensitive to cultural differences in communication styles, nonverbal cues, and health beliefs and adapt their approach accordingly. See <link document="m00213">Culturally and Linguistically Responsive Nursing Care</link> for more information.</para>
<para id="para-00013">Effective communication across cultures is a cornerstone of inclusive and compassionate nursing care, encompassing not only differences in ethnicity and language but also in sexual orientation, gender identity, and diversity in relationships. For example, recognizing and respecting the unique needs of LGBTQIA+ individuals is vital in fostering trust and understanding. One tangible step is to include nonbinary choices on intake forms, allowing clients to identify themselves in a way that feels most authentic. This seemingly simple action sends a strong message of acceptance and can significantly impact the client’s comfort and willingness to engage in care. Additionally, environmental factors such as displaying LGBTQIA+ inclusive symbols, offering gender-neutral restrooms, and inclusive signage can further promote an inclusive atmosphere. Collaborating with LGBTQIA+ advocacy groups and implementing these best practices can help ensure that health care providers are meeting the diverse needs of all clients, demonstrating a commitment to care that respects and honors individual identity and cultural background.</para>
<para id="para-00014">In many cultures, concepts of health and illness are deeply connected to spiritual or religious beliefs. For example, some clients may believe that an illness is caused by a lack of balance between the body, mind, and spirit. To communicate effectively with these clients, health care providers can ask about their spiritual or religious beliefs and how they relate to their health. They can also provide information about spiritual or religious resources that may be available, such as chaplains, clergy, or prayer groups.</para>
<para id="para-00015">Another example of effective communication across cultures is the use of professional interpreters or language services. Clients who have LEP or speak a different language may struggle to communicate their health concerns or understand medical instructions. By using <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">interpreters</term> or language services, health care providers can ensure that clients receive accurate and appropriate care. Interpreters can also help health care providers to understand cultural nuances and provide culturally responsive care.</para>
<para id="para-00016">Finally, health care providers can use <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">visual aids</term> or other materials to communicate effectively with clients from diverse cultural backgrounds. For example, providing information in multiple languages or using pictures or diagrams to explain medical procedures can help to overcome language and cultural <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">barriers</term>. Health care providers can also use <term id="term-00011">cultural brokers</term> or community health workers to help clients navigate the health care system and understand their health needs. Cultural brokers are individuals who act as intermediaries or go-betweens among different cultures. They use their knowledge and understanding of different cultures to help facilitate communication, understanding, and advocacy on behalf of an individual or group. The concept of cultural brokering has evolved and permeated many aspects of U.S. society, including health care, education, and child welfare programs. Cultural brokers can come from various backgrounds and may receive extensive training in cultural humility and community partnerships to better serve their role.</para>

<title>Conducting a Cultural Self-Assessment</title>
<para id="para-00020">Organizations and nurses working in the field of population health are uniquely positioned to understand and meet the diverse cultural needs of the communities they serve. Assessment tools are available to evaluate and enhance the cultural competence of nurses and their practice. For example, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) organizational assessment tools</term> can be utilized as a benchmark, specifically tailored for nursing environments, to guide quality improvement and recognize cultural competence as an ongoing, adaptive process. As introduced previously, institutions like Georgetown University’s NCCC also offer tools such as the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">Cultural and Linguistic Competence Health Practitioner Assessment</term> (CLCHPA), designed to assess nurses’ cultural awareness and responsiveness. Additionally, frameworks like “Becoming a Culturally Competent Nurse in Population Health” provide guidelines and strategies for nursing professionals to develop, implement, and sustain culturally competent care within their practice. These resources emphasize the essential role nurses play in delivering care that is not only clinically effective but also culturally sensitive, ultimately contributing to the overall well-being and health of diverse populations.</para>
<para id="para-00021">Although the <link url="https://openstax.org/r/clchpa">CLCHPA</link> is an individual assessment for health practitioners, having culturally competent providers within an organization enhances the organization’s cultural competence as a whole. The CCHPA is based on three assumptions: (1) cultural competence is a developmental process at both the individual and organizational levels; (2) with appropriate support, individuals can enhance their cultural awareness, knowledge, and skills over time; and (3) cultural strengths exist within organizations or networks of professionals but often go unnoticed and untapped (NCCC, 2006).</para>
<para id="para-00022">The CLCHPA has six subscales:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00008">
<item>Values and Belief Systems</item>
<item>Cultural Aspects of Epidemiology</item>

<section id="sect-00007">
<title>Understanding and Applying Cultural Knowledge</title>
<para id="para-00024">To apply cultural knowledge, health care providers should use culturally competent communication skills to understand their clients’ cultural backgrounds and how that might affect their health beliefs, behaviors, and preferences. According to Campinha-Bacote (2002), culturally competent communication involves being aware of one’s own cultural biases and assumptions—using appropriate language and nonverbal communication—and actively listening to clients to understand their unique perspectives. Providers can tailor their care to meet the individual needs of each client.</para>
<para id="para-00025">Health care providers should also be aware of the impact of organizational culture on health care quality. Health care organizations with a strong culture of safety and quality are more likely to provide high-quality care and improve client outcomes. Providers can use their knowledge of organizational culture to identify areas for improvement and drive change within their organizations to improve quality and eliminate health care disparities. Applying cultural knowledge in health care involves understanding and respecting the cultural beliefs and values of individual clients while also recognizing the impact of organizational culture on health care quality. By doing so, nurses can improve client outcomes and provide more equitable care to all clients.</para>

Here are some specific ways that health care organizations can advocate for culturally and linguistically responsive practices:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00010">
<item>Provide training and education to nurses and other health care providers: Health care organizations can provide cultural competency training and education to their staff to increase their understanding of different cultures, values, beliefs, and practices. This can include training on how to communicate effectively with clients who have LEP, as well as education on cultural diversity and sensitivity.</item>
<item>Use interpreters: Health care organizations can ensure that clients with LEP have access to qualified interpreters. This can include in-person interpreters, telephone interpreters, or video interpreters, depending on the needs of the client.</item>
<item>Use translated materials: Health care organizations can provide translated materials in languages commonly spoken by the client population they serve. This can include client education materials, consent forms, and other important documents.</item>
<item>Engage with community organizations: Health care organizations can partner with community organizations to better understand the health care needs of their client population. This can include collaborating with community leaders to develop culturally appropriate outreach and education programs.</item>

<title>The ACCESS Model</title>
<para id="para-00035">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">ACCESS model</term> is a comprehensive approach to promoting cultural competence in health care services. It emphasizes the importance of awareness, knowledge, and skills in providing effective care for diverse populations. By understanding the unique cultural perspectives and experiences of clients, health care providers can work to build trust, reduce disparities, and improve health outcomes.</para>
<para id="para-00036">Nurses and other health care providers can use the ACCESS model to deliver culturally responsive care by first assessing clients’ cultural background and beliefs and then adapting their communication style and negotiating a care plan that is respectful of the client’s beliefs and values. Nurses can also establish a trusting relationship with clients by demonstrating sensitivity to nonverbal cues and ensuring that the client feels safe and comfortable in the health care setting.</para>
<section id="sect-00010">
<title>Components of the ACCESS Model</title>
<para id="para-00037">The ACCESS model is a framework that health care providers can use to deliver culturally competent care to clients from diverse backgrounds. The model consists of six key components: assessment, communication, cultural negotiation and compromise, establishing respect and rapport, sensitivity, and safety (Narayanansamy, 1999). Assessment involves evaluating a client’s <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">cultural background</term>, including their health beliefs and practices. Additionally, understanding the client’s previous interaction with the health care system, such as LGBTQIA+ clients, is needed. This information can help nurses and other health care providers tailor care plans to meet the unique needs of each client:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00011">
<item><emphasis effect="underline">Communication</emphasis> is a critical component of delivering transcultural care. Nurses must be aware of and use the cultural communication norms of the client, both verbal and nonverbal, to ensure effective communication.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="underline">Cultural negotiation and compromise</emphasis> involve being aware of cultural differences and understanding how the client perceives the health care issue. This can help nurses and other health care providers tailor care plans that are respectful of the client’s beliefs and values.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="underline">Establishing respect and rapport</emphasis> is vital for clients to maintain their dignity.

This includes using terms that clients understand to explain their health situation and trying to understand their needs pertaining to their culture and beliefs.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="underline">Safety</emphasis> is the idea that health care providers should not engage in any action that disrespects the client’s culture, which could cause the client to feel culturally unsafe. This component emphasizes the importance of cultural sensitivity and respect in delivering effective health care services.</item>

<title>Using the ACCESS Model as a Framework to Deliver Transcultural Nursing Care</title>
<para id="para-00038">The ACCESS model provides nurses with a comprehensive framework for delivering transcultural nursing care. As discussed in <link document="m00209">Transcultural Nursing</link>, transcultural nursing seeks to provide culturally sensitive and competent care to individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds. By assessing cultural backgrounds, communicating effectively, acquiring cultural knowledge, establishing supportive care environments, and seeking client feedback, nurses can enhance their cultural competence and deliver care that is sensitive, respectful, and culturally responsive.</para>
<para id="para-00039">The first step of the ACCESS model involves assessing the cultural background of individuals and understanding how it shapes their health beliefs and behaviors. This supports the development of a culturally sensitive care plan tailored to their specific needs. According to Romem et al. (2021), by conducting a comprehensive assessment, nurses can identify cultural factors that may influence health practices and beliefs, facilitating the delivery of client-centered and culturally responsive care.</para>
<para id="para-00040">Effective communication is pivotal to transcultural nursing care. It involves using inclusive language, avoiding assumptions, and ensuring cultural nuances are acknowledged. The ACCESS model emphasizes the importance of clear communication and understanding clients’ preferences. Effective communication involves active listening, being respectful, and acknowledging cultural differences, which can foster trust and enhance client-provider rapport (Narayanasamy, 2002).</para>
<para id="para-00041">Cultural knowledge is essential for providing quality care to culturally diverse clients. The ACCESS model promotes cultural competence by encouraging nurses to continually update and broaden their knowledge of diverse cultures and communities. Sharifi et al. (2019) emphasize the importance of nurses familiarizing themselves with the customs, beliefs, values, and practices of various cultures to provide culturally sensitive care.</para>
<para id="para-00042">A supportive care environment is crucial for promoting positive health outcomes among clients from diverse cultural backgrounds. The ACCESS model suggests displaying visual cues such as posters or brochures that show support for different cultures. Providing a welcoming environment that respects clients’ unique backgrounds and values is associated with improved client satisfaction and better health outcomes (Medina-Martínez et al., 2021).</para>
<para id="para-00043">The final step of the ACCESS model involves seeking client feedback and continuously evaluating the effectiveness of care. By actively involving clients in their care and soliciting their feedback, nurses can identify areas for improvement and adjust accordingly. Medina-Martínez (2021) highlighted the importance of client feedback in identifying areas of cultural insensitivity within health care settings, which underscores the need for ongoing evaluation to provide quality, person-centered care. <link target-id="table-00001" document="m00222"/> provides an example of using the ACCESS model with a client.</para>

<title>Applying the ACCESS Model</title>
<para id="para-00044">The following scenario continues to follow Emily’s work with Hyeon. Read the scenario, and then respond to the questions that follow. Working with the interpreter, Emily helps schedule regular follow-up visits and establishes clear communication channels for any questions or concerns between visits. Hyeon’s recovery proceeds smoothly, and her cultural and linguistic needs are met, leading to a positive client experience and adherence to the care plan.</para>
<para id="para-00045">The home care nurse can also use the ACCESS model as a framework for this scenario:</para>
<para id="para-00046"><emphasis effect="bold">A</emphasis>—Assessment: Emily begins with a comprehensive assessment of Hyeon’s needs, including her language proficiency, cultural background, family dynamics, and medical condition. Emily’s recognition that using a family member as an interpreter is not best practice is part of this initial assessment.</para>
<para id="para-00047"><emphasis effect="bold">C</emphasis>—Communication: Emily ensures that communication is clear and effective by engaging a professional interpreter. Although Hyeon’s daughter speaks English well, Emily opts for professional services to maintain objectivity and accuracy in conveying medical information.</para>
<para id="para-00048"><emphasis effect="bold">C</emphasis>—Cultural Competence: Emily actively seeks to understand Korean cultural norms and beliefs that may influence Hyeon’s care. This includes respecting preferences such as modesty during physical assessments and considering cultural attitudes toward health, illness, and family roles.</para>
<para id="para-00049"><emphasis effect="bold">E</emphasis>—Establishment of Mutual Goals: Emily involves Hyeon’s family in the care plan and sets recovery goals that align with Hyeon’s cultural values and expectations. By involving the family, she ensures that the care plan is acceptable and tailored to Hyeon’s individual needs.</para>
<para id="para-00050"><emphasis effect="bold">S</emphasis>—Sensitivity: Emily exhibits sensitivity to Hyeon’s cultural background, recognizing that care practices must be adapted to meet her unique needs. This includes connecting Hyeon with Korean community centers and being mindful of dietary preferences and other culturally specific aspects of care.</para>
<para id="para-00051"><emphasis effect="bold">S</emphasis>—Support: Regular follow-up visits and clear communication channels support Hyeon’s ongoing care. Emily’s approach facilitates a smooth recovery process, ensures adherence to the care plan, and leads to a positive client experience.</para>
<para id="para-00052">By utilizing the ACCESS model, Emily is able to deliver care that is culturally sensitive, respectful, and effective. Emily works to understand and respect Hyeon’s cultural background, beliefs, and values while also ensuring her safety and comfort. This helps to build trust and rapport, which is essential for providing effective care.</para>
