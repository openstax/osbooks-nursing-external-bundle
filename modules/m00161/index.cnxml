<para id="para-00002">The <term id="term-00001">epidemiological triad</term> posits that disease is caused by the interaction between a susceptible host, an external agent, and an environment that brings the host and agent together (CDC, 2012). It reflects the idea that health is not the result of one factor but rather results from the interaction of these elements (Celentano &amp; Szklo, 2019).</para>
<para id="para-00003">The <term id="term-00002">host</term> can be an individual, a family, a group of high-risk individuals, or a community. Host factors include immunologic characteristics such as prior history of infection or immunization; modifiable factors such as exercise level, nutrition, and lifestyle; and non-modifiable factors such as age, race, and genes.</para>
<para id="para-00004">The <term id="term-00003">agent</term> is something that can cause a health issue, and the environment is the context within which the agent and host interact. Agents are classified into five categories: physical (trauma, radiation, heat), chemical (pollutants, medications, drugs, alcohol, smoke), nutritional (lack of or excess of), psychosocial (stress, social isolation), and biologic (bacteria, viruses, arthropods, toxins). The <term id="term-00004">pathogenicity</term> of the agent, or its ability to cause disease, influences disease onset. An agent must be present for a disease to occur, but the presence of an agent does not always cause disease; a variety of factors influence whether exposure to an agent will result in disease (CDC, 2012).</para>
<para id="para-00005"><term id="term-00005">Environmental factors</term> include the biologic environment of plants, animals, and toxins, including <emphasis effect="italics"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">vectors</term></emphasis> (life forms such as mosquitoes or ticks that carry infectious agents) and the <emphasis effect="italics"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">reservoir</term>s</emphasis> where vectors and infectious agents are normally found. Other environmental factors are physical and social in nature, such as neighborhoods, housing, temperature, altitude, presence of crowding, air pollution, radiation, water quality, and noise.</para>
<para id="para-00006">The epidemiological triad (<link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00161"/>) shows how host, agent, and environment can interact to cause disease. (Note that this model is incomplete for diseases that have other kinds of contributing causes, such as cardiovascular disease.) A good example of the epidemiological triangle is cholera, the diarrheal illness that John Snow linked to contaminated water. In the John Snow example, the host was the susceptible individual who consumed the contaminated water. The agent was <emphasis effect="italics">Vibrio cholerae</emphasis> bacteria. The environment was the contaminated water system.</para>

<section id="sect-00002">
<title>Natural History of Disease</title>
<para id="para-00007">In the absence of treatment, diseases in individuals follow a natural progression, referred to as the <term id="term-00008">natural history of disease</term> (CDC, 2012). The natural history of disease encompasses events that occur before, during, and after the conclusion of a disease. The process involves multiple interactions between host, agent, and environment.</para>
<para id="para-00008">The natural progression of a disease has four stages: susceptibility, subclinical (preclinical) disease, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">clinical disease</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">resolution</term> (recovery, disability, or death) (CDC, 2012) (<link target-id="fig-00002" document="m00161"/>). The initial interactions between agent, host, and environment occur during the susceptibility stage, or the pre-pathogenesis period, during which <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">primary prevention</term> measures could be implemented to prevent onset of the disease. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">Pathogenesis</term> (onset and progression of a disease) begins when the host has clinical disease, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">secondary prevention</term> measures focus on early diagnosis and treatment to limit resulting disabilities (CDC, 2012).</para>
<figure id="fig-00002"><media alt="The four stages of disease progression are shown in order from left to right along an arrow. The stages are susceptibility, subclinical disease, clinical disease, and recovery, disability, and death. Perpendicular lines cross the arrow to marking the event that signals the shift from one stage to the next. Exposure marks the shift from susceptibility to subclinical disease. Pathologic changes mark the shift from subclinical disease to clinical disease. Onset of symptoms and usual time of diagnosis mark the shift from clinical disease to recovery, disability, or death."><image mime-type="image/jpg" src="../../media/PH_Figure_12_03_004.png"/></media>
<caption>There are four stages of disease progression: susceptibility, subclinical (preclinical) disease, clinical disease, and resolution (recovery, disability, or death). (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)</caption></figure>
<para id="para-00009">The process begins with the <term id="term-00014">susceptibility stage</term>, or exposure of a susceptible host. In communicable diseases, the exposure is to a microorganism. In noncommunicable diseases like cancer, the exposure could be a factor that instigates the process, such as tobacco smoke (lung cancer). Once the disease process begins, pathologic changes occur without the host being aware of them. In this <term id="term-00015">subclinical disease stage</term>, individuals have no overt symptoms. In infectious diseases, this stage includes an <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">incubation</term> period during which the pathogen multiplies to produce clinical symptoms. In noninfectious disease, it includes a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">latency period</term> (the time from exposure to onset of symptoms). The latency period may be as brief as seconds for acute hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions or as long as decades for certain chronic diseases. In the <term id="term-00018">clinical disease stage</term>, signs of the disease develop, and diagnosis may occur. In the resolution stage, the disease may end with a return to health, a chronic form of the disease with limitations, or death (CDC, 2012).</para>
<para id="para-00010">In the subclinical stage, although disease is not yet apparent, there may be pathologic changes that can be detected with laboratory evaluation of blood work, radiographic evidence, or other screening methods. Many screening programs aim to identify the disease process early, as intervention in the early stage is often more effective than after the disease has progressed to symptoms (CDC, 2012).</para>
<para id="para-00011">The onset of symptoms marks the clinical disease stage in which most diagnoses occur. Some individuals may never progress to clinical disease, while others may have mild to severe illness. The severity of a disease is impacted by the infectivity, pathogenicity, and virulence of infectious agents. With any infectious disease, there are often many undiagnosed cases, as there will always be individuals who never progress to the clinical stage.</para>
<para id="para-00012">Individuals who have only subclinical disease but are infectious are termed <term id="term-00019">carriers</term>. Carriers are individuals with incubating disease or preclinical infection. For example, an individual infected with measles becomes infectious days before symptoms appear. Carriers are usually unaware they are infectious and are more likely to spread infection than those with obvious illness (CDC, 2012). Chronic carriers carry pathogens after recovering from the initial illness and may carry these pathogens for months or years. Examples include chronic carriers of hepatitis B virus and <emphasis effect="italics">Salmonella</emphasis> Typhi, the causative agent of typhoid fever. Typhoid Mary, Mary Mallon, was an asymptomatic chronic carrier of <emphasis effect="italics">Salmonella</emphasis> Typhi who, as a cook in the early 1900s, unknowingly infected many individuals in New York before her condition was identified and she was quarantined (CDC, 2012).</para>

<title>Chain of Infection</title>
<para id="para-00013">The <term id="term-00020">chain of infection</term> is an epidemiological model that allows for a more complex and nuanced interplay between the host, agent, and environment of the epidemiological triad (<link target-id="fig-00003" document="m00161"/>). The <emphasis effect="italics">agent</emphasis> is the virus or bacteria itself. The other elements of the chain of infection are discussed below.</para>
<figure class="scaled-down" id="fig-00003"><media alt="The components of the chain of infection are shown with each component linked to the next in a continuous circle. The components are: portal of exit, mode of transmission, agent, portal of entry, host, and reservoir."><image mime-type="image/jpg" src="../../media/PH_Figure_12_03_005.png"/></media>

<section id="sect-00004">
<title>Reservoir</title>
<para id="para-00014">The <term id="term-00021">reservoir</term> is where the causal agent normally lives and reproduces. Reservoirs include the environment, humans, and animals. Communicable diseases that are transmitted from person to person—for example, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), measles, mumps, and many respiratory pathogens—are considered to have human reservoirs (CDC, 2012). As discussed, human reservoirs may be symptomatic, asymptomatic, or chronic disease carriers. With animal reservoirs (when the disease is transmissible from animals to humans, referred to as zoonosis), humans become accidental hosts. Examples include plague (from rodents) and rabies (from bats, dogs, and other mammals). Many newly recognized infectious diseases in humans, including West Nile encephalitis, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), Ebola infection, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), are thought to have emerged from animal hosts (CDC, 2012). Soil, water, and plants are considered environmental reservoirs. Many fungal agents live in the soil, and Legionella bacteria, the cause of Legionnaires’ disease, often live in water within evaporative condensers (CDC, 2012).</para>
</section>
<section id="sect-00005">
<title>Portal of Exit</title>
<para id="para-00015">The <term id="term-00022">portal of exit</term> from the reservoir is how the agent leaves its home, which enables it to act as the mode of transmission. Respiratory viruses such as influenza or tuberculosis exit the respiratory tract where the pathogen resides within its host. In pregnant clients, some bloodborne agents such as syphilis can cross the placenta and infect the baby. Another portal of exit for bloodborne agents can be via cuts or needle punctures in the skin as can occur with hepatitis B or C, or even via a blood-drinking mosquito, as occurs with malaria (CDC, 2012).</para>

<title>Portal of Entry</title>
<para id="para-00017">The <term id="term-00027">portal of entry</term> is how the agent infects a susceptible host. The portal of entry must provide contact with tissues that will allow it to reproduce or allow the toxin of the agent to act (CDC, 2012). Many infectious agents use the same portal to enter a host that they used to exit the source; for example, pertussis (whooping cough) exits the respiratory tract of the original host and enters the respiratory tract of the new host. The portal of exit and portal of entry can be the same, as in the case of malaria via a mosquito bite. Some infectious pathogens exit the source host in feces and are carried via unwashed hands to a vehicle-borne vector, such as food, to enter the new host through the mouth. This is known as the fecal-oral route (CDC, 2012). The skin, mucous membranes, and blood are other portals of entry (CDC, 2012).</para>
</section>
<section id="sect-00008">
<title>Host</title>
<para id="para-00018">A susceptible host is a key component and final link in the chain of infection. Host susceptibility depends on a multitude of genetic, nonspecific, and lifestyle factors. Genetic factors of age, gender, physical health, and immune status; nonspecific factors such as skin integrity, gastric acidity, and respiratory tract anatomy; and lifestyle factors such as malnutrition, chronic disease, and alcoholism (CDC, 2012) all contribute to a host’s susceptibility. An example of a genetic makeup that decreases a host’s susceptibility is the sickle cell trait. Individuals with this genetic alteration are partially protected against certain types of malaria. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">Immunity</term> refers to either prior immunization or prior exposure to a pathogen affording protective antibodies. By interrupting and stopping the chain of causation at any of the links, disease can be prevented.</para>

<section id="sect-00009">
<title>Web of Causation</title>
<para id="para-00019">By the mid-20th century, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029">antibiotics</term> and vaccines to prevent or treat infections shifted public health attention away from infectious diseases to noninfectious diseases like cancer and diabetes. In the 1960s, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00030">web of causation</term> became an epidemiological model to demonstrate the concept of multiple causation in the health and illness spectrum (Ventriglio et al., 2016). This model helps describe the multiple factors that underlie many chronic illnesses, giving each causative factor equal prominence in identifying determinants of disease. The emergence of the web of causation represented a shift in thinking about disease and suggested that the combination of multiple factors was the determining influence in the development of poor outcomes (Ventriglio et al., 2016). Epidemiologists today continue to make associations among lifestyle choices, behaviors, the environment, and even the social determinants of health and their relationship to health outcomes.</para>

<title>Chapter Summary</title>
<para id="para-00020">The epidemiologic triad describes disease as a result of the relationship among a susceptible host, an external agent, and an environment that brings the host and agent together. The chain of infection is an epidemiological model that depicts the complex, nuanced interplay between the host, agent, and environment and includes a reservoir, portal of exit, mode of transmission, agent, portal of entry, and host. The natural history of disease follows diseases through stages: susceptibility in a host, subclinical disease where disease carriers become a concern, and clinical disease in which overt symptoms are present. Understanding these epidemiological approaches enables nurses to direct the most appropriate public health intervention at any link in the chain of infection.</para>
