<title>Impact of Maternal Health During Pregnancy</title>
<para id="para-00015">Proper nutrition in pregnancy is even more important for pregnant clients in poor health, which can result from underlying medical conditions or malnutrition. A pregnant client in poor health may be at higher risk for <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">nutrient deficiencies</term>, such as deficiencies of calcium or vitamin D, which can negatively affect bone strength and density. Insufficient nutrient intake may increase the likelihood of conditions such as osteoporosis, fractures, or impaired bone formation in the pregnant client and the developing fetus. Inadequate protein intake can lead to muscle wasting, weakness, and reduced muscle function in pregnant clients with poor health, thereby affecting their overall physical strength and ability to perform daily activities (Azzolino et al., 2021).</para>
<para id="para-00016">Poor health may also increase the risk for nutrient deficiencies, such as iron, folate, vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, or vitamin C.

<title>Infancy</title>
<para id="para-00019">Infancy is a time of rapid musculoskeletal and integumentary growth, so dietary considerations are critical to ensure healthy bones, muscles, and skin. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">Breastfeeding</term> does not provide an infant with enough vitamin D. To prevent musculoskeletal disorders and to promote healthy skeletal growth, it is recommended that all breastfed infants receive <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">vitamin D supplementation</term>. Supplementation with 400IU of vitamin D per day should begin in the first few days of life and should be provided to exclusively breastfed infants and breastfed infants supplemented with commercial <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">formula</term> (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021). Vitamin D supplementation should continue until the infant is weaned and has adequate intake of vitamin D–rich foods.</para>
<para id="para-00020">Regular <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020">dental checkups</term> are important for the infant. The infant should see a dentist as soon as their first tooth erupts, and some dentists recommend a visit even before this time to help them get used to the environment. Regular <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00021">fluoride</term> supplementation becomes necessary through water or toothpaste when an infant begins to eat solid foods. Standard formulas contain fluoride that a breastfed infant does not receive, so breastfed infants need supplemental fluoride after six months of age. Nurses should encourage parents to begin brushing their infant’s teeth as they erupt, using fluoride toothpaste according to their dentist’s recommendations (American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, 2023).</para>
<para id="para-00021">It is also important for infants to begin to “exercise” their muscles and bones as soon as possible for optimal growth and development. As soon as a baby is born, a parent should encourage supervised “tummy time.” This activity helps infants build the strength necessary for rolling over, crawling, and exploring the world. It also helps infants strengthen their neck muscles and develop head control and can be introduced around 3–4 months old.</para>

It can also occur in newborns whose mothers were deficient in calcium and vitamin D. Osteopenia is most likely in an infant born before 30 weeks’ gestation because the majority of calcium uptake occurs during the third trimester of fetal life. A preterm newborn with osteopenia may exhibit no symptoms but is at increased risk for fractures. Osteopenia and the risk for fracture continue through the preterm infant’s first year of life.</para>
<para id="para-00023">Newborns identified as high risk for developing osteopenia or fractures, such as preterm infants, are monitored and may receive fortifiers with their feedings to help them retain calcium and phosphorus (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2022).</para>

<para id="para-00042">Adolescence is also thought to be a key time for <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00036">muscle development</term>. Leading an active lifestyle and avoiding saturated fats and highly processed sugars during adolescence can promote healthy body mass distribution later in life (Azzolino et al., 2021).</para>
<para id="para-00043">Adolescent <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00037">athletes</term> have increased nutritional needs because they are performing intense physical activity while still growing and developing. As a result of their increased energy needs, they must consume adequate amounts of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Carbohydrates come in a variety of forms, but it is important that adolescent athletes avoid highly processed sugars, which increase risk for diabetes and obesity. For optimal performance, they should strive to consume whole grains, fruits, legumes, and vegetables.</para>
<para id="para-00044">Protein helps restore muscle lost through exercise, so the athlete should consume adequate amounts of fish, poultry, meat, and other protein sources. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00038">protein</term> needs of adolescent athletes can vary depending on factors such as age, sex, body size, activity level, and training intensity. However, in general, the protein requirements for adolescent athletes are higher than those of their more sedentary peers because of the increased demands of physical activity and muscle development. Nurses can estimate the recommended daily protein intake for adolescent athletes based on their body weight; adolescent athletes should consume approximately 10–30% of their daily calories from protein (Klemm, 2020). Protein shakes are not necessary for healthy adolescent athletes, and they should strive to get their protein from natural food sources.</para>

<title>Adulthood</title>
<para id="para-00045">Adulthood is a time for optimal health and health preservation. During adulthood, it is important to eat a variety of nutrient-rich foods containing protein, calcium, and vitamin D and remain physically active to maintain bone density and mass. Healthy adults have no special requirements for supplementation, but they should aim to ingest adequate micronutrients and macronutrients to maintain healthy bones, muscles, and skin.</para>
<para id="para-00046">Barriers to physical activity during adulthood include increased pressures and time constraints, especially for students, working adults, and those with families. The convenience of highly processed foods has contributed to a rise in cancers and obesity throughout the world (Isaksen &amp; Dankel, 2023; Hall et al., 2019). Choosing healthier alternatives to fast food is a great way for adults to improve their overall nutrition and well-being and to set a healthy example for children.</para>
<para id="para-00047">Many adults now reach for shakes and protein powders for convenience over whole foods. While protein powders are convenient, they are unnecessary for most individuals (Gelsomin, 2020). Most individuals, even active <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00039">athletes</term>, can obtain the necessary protein requirements for a healthy musculoskeletal system through diet alone. The risks and disadvantages of using <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00040">protein supplements</term> are related to the actual content of the product (Harvard Health Publishing, 2022). The FDA does not regulate the nutritional content of these products, so the actual ingredients may vary from the label and may include contaminants. In addition to the protein, the supplements may contain a lot of sugar and calories.</para>

<title>Lactation</title>
<para id="para-00049">Dietary considerations for a client who is <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00041">breastfeeding</term> consist of increasing caloric intake by an additional 330 to 400 calories per day to a total of 2,000 to 2,800 calories per day (CDC, 2022). Additionally, clients who are lactating women may need iodine and choline supplements because increased amounts of those nutrients are needed—290 mcg of iodine and 550 mg of choline (CDC, 2022). Maternal <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00042">bone density</term> temporarily decreases during <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00043">lactation</term>, but bone loss is usually regained following weaning.

<para id="para-00050">The impact of breastfeeding on the musculoskeletal system is highly individualized and depends on overall diet, hydration, and physical activity.

<title>Menopause</title>
<para id="para-00051"><emphasis effect="bold"><term id="term-00044">Menopause</term></emphasis> occurs in middle adulthood and is associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis. During menopause, estrogen, which helps prevent bone breakdown, decreases, which in turn leads to decreases in bone density and bone mass. Some clients may develop <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00045">fractures</term> as a result. Therefore, the health care provider should monitor bone density and encourage women to consume the recommended daily intake for calcium and vitamin D. Weight-bearing exercise and maintenance of a healthy weight also help prevent age-related osteoporotic changes during and after menopause. This is important because bone fractures are associated with significant decreases in quality of life as well as increased mortality risk (Endocrine Society, 2022).</para>

<para id="para-00053">In addition to musculoskeletal breakdown, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00049">skin</term> becomes thinner and more fragile with age. When older adults lack adequate protein intake, several factors can lead to the development of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00050">pressure ulcers</term>: Because protein intake is needed for the development of collagen, which is itself a protein that provides structural support to the skin, insufficient protein can lead to skin that is thinner and more fragile, increasing the risk for shearing and wounds. Older adults who are bedbound or use a wheelchair are at even greater risk for pressure ulcers and wounds. In addition, protein plays an important role in skin regeneration and wound healing; if wounds and tissue are not regenerating fast enough, pressure ulcers are more likely to develop. For these reasons, nurses should encourage adequate protein intake to help promote integumentary health in this population.</para>
<section id="sect-00018">
<title>Osteoporosis</title>
<para id="para-00054">Osteoporosis in older adults results from natural decreases in bone mass and bone mineral density. It develops when the osteoclasts outpace the osteoblasts, resulting in more bone breakdown than buildup. These changes increase the risk for fracture in the older adult. Osteoporosis is a silent disease in which symptoms typically do not appear until an acute fracture occurs. Although it can occur in both men in women, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00051">osteoporosis</term> is much more common in older women, and the risk for fracture is higher in older women than in older men. Modifiable risk factors for osteoporosis include vitamin D deficiency, low calcium intake, excessive consumption of alcohol, and smoking.</para>
<para id="para-00055">Individuals with an average risk for fractures should perform 150–300 minutes of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00052">weight-bearing exercise</term> a week, and consume the recommended daily allowance of dietary calcium and vitamin D for bone health (The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2021). There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of calcium and vitamin D supplements for average-risk individuals. Clients at higher risk for <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00053">fractures</term> because of comorbid conditions or medication regimens, should consult with their healthcare provider regarding their need for supplementation. Combined calcium and vitamin D supplementation is recommended for individuals at high risk for vitamin C and vitamin D insufficiency (Reid &amp; Bolland, 2020).</para>
<para id="para-00056">Several tools are available for osteoporosis screening in older adults. One of the most common risk assessments is the <emphasis effect="bold"><term id="term-00054">FRAX assessment</term></emphasis>, which is used to estimate a person’s risk for a bone fracture within 10 years. This information can help the nurse and client plan care and implement strategies to help mitigate risks in the home and other environments (University of Sheffield, n.d.).</para>

<title>Osteoporosis in Men</title>
<para id="para-00058">Osteoporosis is more common in postmenopausal women, but following a fracture later in life, men statistically experience more significant morbidity and mortality than women do (Burmeister et al., 2021). The increase in age-related factures starts later in men because they start with greater bone mass and their rate of bone loss is slower (National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, 2023a). The older adult man should strive to consume between 1,200 and1,500 mg per day of calcium and between 800 and 2,000 International Units per day of vitamin D to help decrease their risk for osteoporosis (Burmeister et al., 2021).</para>
