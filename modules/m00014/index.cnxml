<title>Mineral Function</title>
<para id="para-00002">Minerals are common in cereals, bread, meat, fish, milk, dairy, nuts, fruit (especially in dried form), and vegetables. About 20 <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">minerals</term> are essential for body function, all in varying amounts depending on their role. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">macrominerals</term> are needed at levels higher than 100 mg/day, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">trace minerals</term> are needed in amounts less than 100 mg/day (Farag et al., 2023). <link target-id="table-00001" document="m00014"/> lists the macro (M) and trace (T) minerals and their functions.</para>

<caption>Essential Minerals and Their Functions</caption>
</table>
<para id="para-00003">Minerals work synergistically. For example, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020">sodium-to-potassium ratio</term> is essential in maintaining normal blood pressure and impacts <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00021">blood pressure</term> more than sodium or potassium alone. Likewise, the proper relationship between calcium and phosphorus is vital in maintaining normal bone structure. As with vitamins, one mineral cannot assume the function of another mineral, and a shortage or deficiency of any mineral will impact body function.</para>
<para id="para-00004">Mineral <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00022">absorption</term> takes place primarily in the small intestine. For some minerals, absorption efficiency depends on specific needs such as calcium absorption in pregnancy. During pregnancy, calcium absorption takes place actively, which requires energy to transport across the cell membrane. In times of plentiful serum calcium, the body switches to a passive diffusion method of absorption.</para>
<para id="para-00005">Mineral absorption can be helped or hindered by other dietary components that occur naturally in food. For example, iron is best absorbed in an acid environment, so health professionals recommend taking an <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00023">iron supplement</term> with orange juice. Juxtaposed is the absorption of minerals in the presence of phytates (found in whole grains) that interfere with calcium, iron, magnesium, and zinc absorption.</para>

<title>Mineral Intake for Wellness</title>
<para id="para-00007">Minerals play an essential role in various metabolic and physiologic processes. A deeper dive into cellular nutrition reveals that minerals are critical for the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">metabolism</term> of every cell in the body. A well-balanced mineral intake is essential throughout the human lifecycle, although specific needs may vary based on age and sex (Farag, et al., 2023). For example, the iron needs of premenopausal clients are higher than postmenopausal clients because of the iron loss during menstruation. A diet comprised of vegetables, legumes, nuts, lean meats, and seafood provides all the essential minerals needed throughout a person’s life.</para>
<para id="para-00008"><term id="term-00025">Food fortification</term> (the practice of intentionally increasing the content of one or more micronutrients) makes meeting the required mineral DV easier. For example, in the mid-1920s, in response to an increase in <term id="term-00026">goiter</term>, iodine was added to table salt (Leung, Braverman, and Pearce, 2012). Goiter is an increase in thyroid size resulting from either iodine deficiency or hyperthyroidism. Vitamin D was first added to milk in 1933 in response to the presence of childhood rickets (IOM, 2003; United Nations, 2019). Today, food fortification continues. Two more current examples are the addition of calcium to orange juice and iron and folate to breakfast cereals. Even though some breakfast cereals are fortified with essential vitamins and minerals, many should not be considered nutritionally sound because they are high in added sugar. Fortification does not guarantee nutritional excellence.</para>

<title>Mineral Daily Values</title>
<para id="para-00009">As with vitamins, there are also mineral DV percentages. You can <link url="https://openstax.org/r/factsheets">find vitamin and mineral information</link> on the NIH website, which contains a list of vitamins and minerals with hyperlinks to more detailed information on each (select the mineral of interest and then proceed to the option of health professional).</para>

<title>Micronutrients</title>
<para id="para-00010">Research indicates an increasing use of micronutrient supplements, specifically single-nutrient supplements (Cowan et al, 2020). Is it better to take a supplement to ensure you have an adequate supply of micronutrients, or is it possible to get the micronutrients your body needs via food sources? </para>
<para id="para-00011">Social media influencers promote awareness of micronutrient consumption in a person’s diet as a way to assess their individual levels. TicToker @TheWellnessPharm suggests that individuals use a micronutrient testing kit to help determine if they have consistently low levels of specific nutrients. Once identified, individuals can correct deficiencies to promote wellness and enhance disease prevention. Similarly, Instagram hosts several forums dedicated to the discussion of obtaining daily micronutrient requirements from specific foods, often promoting intuitive or mindful eating practice.</para>
