<para id="para-00002"><term id="term-00001">Demographics</term> refers to statistical data regarding the characteristics of the people living in a particular place, describing them based on categories such as age, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">race</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">ethnicity</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">sexual orientation</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">gender identity</term>, ability, education level, income level, and marital status. Individuals belong to many different demographic groups. A person may belong to one group based on age, another group based on race, and a third group based on geographic location, for example. This section examines demographics, focusing on rapidly growing underrepresented populations and on how the growth of these populations affects both public health policies and the provision of health care services.</para>
<section id="sect-00003">
<title>Fastest-Growing Demographics</title>
<para id="para-00003">U.S. Census Bureau forecasts indicate that the United States will continue to experience significant demographic shifts in the next 40 years. By 2060, the U.S. population is expected to increase by 79 million people (U.S. Census Bureau [USCB], 2020), and changing demographics will have major implications for the national health care system. Community health and public health nurses must prepare to serve these changed populations. A more diverse nursing workforce will lead to better health outcomes for populations (American Association of Colleges of Nursing, 2023). This section reviews the most rapidly expanding population groups within the U.S.</para>
<section id="sect-00004">
<title>Baby Boomers</title>
<para id="para-00004">One way to categorize populations is by generation, a period spanning about 20 to 30 years that includes everyone who is born and lives their lives at approximately the same time, experiencing similar social and cultural events. Until recently, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">baby boomers</term>, or the generation born from 1946 to 1964, made up the largest generation in the United States—76 million births—and 71.6 million living adults in 2019 (Fry, 2020). As this large demographic group ages, the number of individuals over the age of 65 continues to increase. For example, although older adults represented 8 percent of the total population in 1950, they made up 16 percent of the population in 2020 and are projected to represent nearly 25 percent of the total population in 2060 (see <link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00126"/>) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2022d).</para>
<para id="para-00005">The USCB estimates that by 2030 all individuals in the United States categorized as baby boomers will be over 65 years old, marking a significant shift toward an older average age in the U.S. population (America Counts Staff, 2019). The growth of the baby boomer population is significant for nurses and other health care professionals because older adults tend to have a higher prevalence of health issues and chronic diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes, hypertension, and arthritis, that are related to aging (CDC, 2022d). As the proportion of older adults in the population increases, the incidence of age-related health conditions and deaths will also increase. Consequently, the need for health care services in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">nursing homes</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">long-term care</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">home health care facilities</term> in the United States will grow.</para>

<title>Racial and Ethnic Minorities</title>
<para id="para-00006">Another projected demographic change in the U.S. population is a shift in the numbers of racial and ethnic minorities in relation to the population as a whole. <term id="term-00010">Ethnic minorities</term> are population groups with a shared culture, tradition, religion, language, history, or other factors living in communities or areas where most people are from a different ethnic group. Between 2020 and 2060, the USCB predicts major changes in the racial and ethnic diversity of the U.S. population. For example, the number of non-Hispanic White individuals is expected to decrease dramatically. In 2020, there were approximately 199 million non-Hispanic White individuals in the United States; that number is expected to fall to approximately 179 million by 2060, a 10 percent decrease. The decline in the non-Hispanic White demographic is related to a decrease in overall births and an increase in deaths over time.</para>
<para id="para-00007">During the same forty-year period, individuals who identify as two or more races are projected to be the fastest-growing racial or ethnic group in the United States. The USCB estimates that Asians will make up the second fastest-growing ethnic group, and Hispanics will be the third fastest. The projected increase in the number of individuals who identify as Hispanic is attributed to an increase in the number of children born to parents who identify as Hispanic in the past decade, while the projected increase in net international migration is the primary driver for an increase in the number of individuals who identify as Asian. The USCB also estimates that the population of individuals who are considered foreign-born will increase from 44 million in 2016 to approximately 69 million in 2060, making up 17 percent of the U.S. population (2020).</para>
<para id="para-00008">For nurses and other health care professionals, these rapidly changing demographics are significant because they have implications for the prevalence of disease and <term id="term-00011">health disparities</term>. The CDC defines health disparities as, “preventable differences in the burden of disease, injury, violence, or opportunities to achieve optimal health that are experienced by socially disadvantaged populations” (CDC, 2020a, para. 1).</para>
<para id="para-00009">Heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and stroke are the most common causes of illness, disability, and death in the United States (CDC, 2022a). <term id="term-00012">Underrepresented populations</term>, such as ethnic minorities, tend to be impacted the most by <term id="term-00013">chronic diseases</term>—conditions like hypertension, diabetes, kidney disease, heart disease, and cancer—that individuals live with for a year or more that require ongoing medical attention, limit the activities of daily living, or both. Underrepresented populations are defined as subgroups within a population often identified by race, ethnicity, age, sex, gender, sexual orientation, or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">socioeconomic status</term>, whose representation in society is disproportionately low relative to their numbers (National Institutes of Health [NIH], 2023b). Chronic diseases affect certain racial and ethnic groups more than others:</para>

<title>Vulnerable Populations</title>
<para id="para-00020">According to the National Collaborating Centre for Determinants of Health, “vulnerability occurs when people are exposed to multiple layers of marginalization, including barriers to social, economic, political, and environmental resources that overlap to increase the risk of poor health. Individuals and communities are vulnerable to, live in vulnerable conditions or are forced into vulnerability rather than being labeled as vulnerable people/populations/groups” (NCCDH, 2023, para. 1). Ethnic and racial minorities are examples of <term id="term-00015">vulnerable populations</term> as many individuals within these groups are at risk of experiencing health disparities. Individuals experiencing poverty—many of whom identify as members of ethnic or racial minorities—are another demographic at risk of poor health outcomes related to lack of access to health care. For example, a 2020 report on income and poverty in the United States revealed the following (Shrider et al., 2020):</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00006">
<item>Between 2019 and 2020, real median household income decreased 2.9 percent to $67,521.</item>
<item>The total number of people with earnings decreased by 3.0 million, and the number of individuals who worked full-time year-round decreased by 13.7 million between 2019 and 2020.</item>
<item>There was a 1.2 percent decrease in real median earnings for all workers.</item>
<item>The official poverty rate increased from 10.5 percent in 2019 to 11.4 percent in 2020.</item>
<item>In 2020, 37.2 million people were living in poverty, up from 33.9 million in 2019.</item>
</list>
<para id="para-00021">Sexual and gender underrepresented populations, which “include, but are not limited to, individuals who identify as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">lesbian</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">gay bisexual</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">asexual</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">transgender</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020">Two-Spirit</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00021">queer</term>, and/or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00022">intersex</term>” (NIH, 2023a, para. 2), are another vulnerable population that is growing. The number of individuals identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender rose significantly between 2010 and 2020. As of 2017, there were approximately 11.4 to 12.2 million adults living in the United States who identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (National Library of Medicine, 2020).</para>
<para id="para-00022">The population of individuals with <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00023">disabilities</term> is another growing vulnerable population. The USCB reported that rates of disability among children under age 18 between 2008 and 2019 increased by 0.4 percentage points. Children who identified as American Indian and Alaskan Natives and those living in poverty had the highest rates of disability (Young &amp; Crankshaw, 2021). In its <link url="https://openstax.org/r/disabilitycompendium">Annual Report on People with Disabilities in America</link>, the University of New Hampshire Institute on Disability (2023) states that the percentage of Americans with disabilities increased from 13.2 percent in 2019 to 13.5 percent in 2021.</para>
<para id="para-00023">For nurses and other health care professionals, these changing demographics are significant because they present challenges in areas across society, including in the workforce, education systems, and health care systems. Vulnerable populations tend to have more health issues such as preventable diseases (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, and obesity) and poor access to care, which leads to increased mortality (deaths) and morbidity rates (diseases). An increase in mortality and morbidity reflects increased health disparities (American Association of Colleges of Nursing, 2023). Members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, intersex, and asexual/aromantic/agender plus other unknowns (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">LGBTQIA+</term>) community—particularly youth—are at increased risk for negative health and life outcomes related to discrimination and stigma. The risk of suicide and substance abuse is high within this age group (CDC, 2023b). Individuals with disabilities are more likely to smoke and have obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. One in four adults in this population is also less likely to have a dedicated health care provider or receive an annual check-up (CDC, 2019a).</para>

<title>What Causes Health Inequities?</title>
<media alt="atoms_isotopes">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://openstax.org/r/healthdisparities"/>
</media>
<para id="para-00024">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00025">World Health Organization (WHO)</term> defines <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00026">health inequities</term> as “systematic differences in the health status of different population groups” (2023, para. 2). Health inequities are the result of human-made systems that favor one group over another. As a result, an unequal distribution of power occurs. The following have been identified as the structural root causes of health inequities: <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00027">racism</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">sexism</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029">classism</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00030">xenophobia</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00031">heterosexism</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00032">ableism</term> (discrimination in favor of able-bodied people). These inequities can occur at the institutional level (how organizations treat others), interpersonal level (individual’s behaviors toward each other), and the internal level (how individuals view themselves). Watch the video for more information about the causes of health inequities.</para>
</note>
<para id="para-00025">In addition to experiencing more health issues, members of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00033">underrepresented communities</term> tend to distrust the health care system because of racism, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00034">bias</term>, and perceived mistreatment. For example, in a Kaiser Family Foundation survey, 78 percent of individuals who identified as White said they trusted their doctors, although only 59 percent of those who identified as Black said they trusted theirs (Hamel et al., 2020).</para>
<para id="para-00026">As discussed in <link document="m00130">Structural Racism and Systemic Inequities</link>, much of this distrust is due to systemic racism—the institutional unfair treatment of individuals based on race—and discrimination against racial minority populations in the United States. The perception by members of underrepresented communities that racism will be present in health care often leads this population to choose not to seek care. The resulting poor health outcomes further exacerbate health disparities between groups within a population. Such disparities are especially present in the areas of cancer screening, neonatal care, pain management, end-of-life care, and the treatment of cardiovascular disease (Huzar, 2021).</para>
<para id="para-00027">Individuals tend to have better health outcomes when they receive care from providers who are familiar with their culture (Nair &amp; Adetayo, 2019). Health care providers should work toward developing greater <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00035">cultural competence</term>—the ability to understand and work with people of cultures other than one’s own—which in turn increases trust within communities. <link target-id="note-00004" document="m00126">Box 5.1</link> provides some suggestions for strategies nurses can use to increase client trust.

<para id="para-00034">Medicaid is a national program, jointly funded by each state and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS, 2022), a federal agency. The program provides health coverage to the following populations: eligible low-income adults, children, pregnant women, older adults, and people with disabilities. Medicaid is administered by individual states according to federal requirements. Each state independently determines its population’s Medicaid coverage and eligibility; to be eligible, an individual must fall within a certain financial category. One outcome of the ACA was to lower Medicaid eligibility requirements, thus increasing opportunities for those needing it; each state determined whether to expand Medicaid.</para>
<para id="para-00035">As of 2023, 38 out of 50 states and the District of Columbia had adopted and implemented expanded Medicaid; Wyoming, Kansas, Wisconsin, Texas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida chose not to adopt Medicaid expansion, and South Dakota and North Carolina had adopted expansion but had not implemented it(Rudowitz et al., 2023). States that chose to expand Medicaid experienced an average reduction in poverty of 0.917 percent or approximately 690,000 individuals lifted above the federal poverty line (Chee, 2019; Zewde &amp; Wimer, 2019). These expansion states experienced increased state revenue as well as cost savings in other government programs that provide services that overlap with Medicaid (Guth &amp; Ammula, 2021). Hospitals and other health care providers in expansion states have seen their profits and revenues increase (Guth &amp; Ammula, 2021). In the states that have not adopted the Medicaid expansion, individuals fall into the coverage gap where their income is too high to qualify for Medicaid but too low to quality for subsidies offered by health insurance plans through the ACA Health Insurance Marketplace (Kagan, 2022). The uninsured rate in these states is almost double the rate of uninsured in states that have expanded Medicaid. (15.4% compared with 8.1%) (Rudowitz et al., 2023). If all states adopted the Medicaid expansion, approximately 3.5 million uninsured adults would become eligible for coverage (Rudowitz et al., 2023).</para>
<para id="para-00036"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00041">Medicare</term>, a federal <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00042">health insurance</term> program, provides health insurance coverage to individuals over age 65 and to those with specific disabilities who are younger than 65. Different parts of Medicare cover different services. Medicare Part A pays for inpatient hospital visits, skilled nursing facilities, hospice care, and some home health care; Part B pays for some outpatient care, doctor’s visits, and preventive services, and Part D covers the cost of prescription drugs (Medicare.gov, n.d.; Medicare Resources, 2023). Sixty-five million Americans receive insurance coverage through Medicare. This includes 57 million older adults and almost 8 million younger adults who have disabilities (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2023). Unlike Medicaid, Medicare is both funded and controlled by the federal government. To address the increasingly aging population—as well as increases in the number of individuals with disabilities—additional Medicare funding is necessary. By 2030 the percentage of American citizens who do not work and rely on those who are employed will exceed 70 percent. Medicare is expected to deplete its reserve by 2035 if the trend of the aging of America continues its current trajectory. In order for Medicare to continue providing for the growing number of recipients, policy change will be needed to fund the program.</para>

<title>Chapter Summary</title>
<para id="para-00037">The makeup of the U.S. population continues to change with communities that have concentrations of demographic groups such as older people, minority racial and ethnic groups, and others often being underrepresented in the social and political power structure. In terms of health care, such groups tend to experience more chronic diseases and more severe stages of these diseases while struggling with a lack of access to and a distrust of health care resources as well as an inability to afford health insurance. The fastest-growing demographics in the U.S. are baby boomers, racial and ethnic minorities, and vulnerable groups like those living in poverty, sexual and gender minorities, and individuals with disabilities. As these demographic changes continue, the delivery of health care will have to change to ensure health equity and the elimination of health disparities, which currently impact underrepresented populations disproportionately throughout the United States.</para>
