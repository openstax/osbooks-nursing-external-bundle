    <title>Evidence-Based Interventions</title>

    <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00003">

    </list>
    <section id="sect-00005">
    <title>Effective Provider Communication</title>
    <para id="para-00008">Effective communication between health care providers plays a vital role in ensuring a seamless transition for clients between different health care settings. Unfortunately, challenges arise due to incomplete health information and the absence of a universally accessible <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">electronic health record</term> (EHR). These limitations impede the ability of acute care providers to access records from ambulatory care and community pharmacy settings, especially when the inpatient provider differs from the primary care provider. Consequently, miscommunication can persist following discharge from the acute care setting, as the primary care provider may not receive comprehensive documentation of the client's diagnostic tests, procedures, and medication changes during hospitalization.</para>
    <para id="para-00009">It is crucial to acknowledge that hospital discharge summaries have been identified as primary sources of communication errors, underscoring the need for improvements in this area (Mansukhani et al., 2015). Without adequate information during transfers, it is difficult to maintain continuity of care. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">National Transitions of Care Coalition (NTOCC)</term> has recognized the barriers to direct communication between health care providers during client transitions and supports the use of a <term id="term-00015">universal transfer tool</term> to facilitate the movement of clients.</para>
    <para id="para-00010">A universal transfer tool can be instrumental in supporting care coordination by standardizing the exchange of client information during care transitions. This tool or form helps ensure that essential information, such as client <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">medical history</term>, current medications, diagnoses, and care instructions, is accurately and comprehensively communicated between different health care settings and providers (Mansukhani et al., 2015). It can facilitate efficient and effective handoffs, reducing the risk of miscommunication, medical errors, and adverse events.</para>
    <para id="para-00011">Moreover, a universal transfer tool enables health care professionals to have a standardized format for documenting and transmitting critical client information, making it more accessible and understandable across different health care personnel and settings. This enhances <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">continuity of care</term>, enables prompt decision-making, and promotes collaborative care planning.</para>
    </section>
    <section id="sect-00006">
    <title>Medication Reconciliation</title>
    <para id="para-00012">Making sure medications are reconciled accurately is a crucial part of the transition process. The Institute for Health Care Improvement explains that medication reconciliation involves creating a precise list of all the medications a client is taking, including the names of the drugs, their strengths, how often they are taken, and how they are administered. This list is then compared to the orders given by the health care provider during admission, transfer, or discharge.</para>
    <para id="para-00013">Throughout a client's care, clinicians may stop, pause, or adjust medications that were previously prescribed to manage or optimize treatment. This makes medication reconciliation during discharge necessary to prevent errors and ensure effective communication for post-acute care. This process involves repeating the initial reconciliation done at admission right before the client is discharged or transferred to another health care setting. The medication list is checked again for accuracy and completeness, and it is shared with the next level of care along with any new prescriptions and written instructions.</para>
    <para id="para-00014">The accuracy and completeness of the discharge medication list largely depend on how accurately and completely the medication reconciliation was done at the time of admission. If the list of medications taken at home is incomplete or inaccurate, discrepancies will arise after discharge. For example, studies have found that clients’ discharge medication lists frequently contain at least one discrepancy (Mueller et al., 2023; Caleres et al., 2020; Lalonde, 2008). Tomlinson et al. (2020) noted that interventions that best support older clients’ medication continuity are those that bridge transitions; these also have the greatest impact on reducing hospital readmission. Interventions that included self-management, telephone follow-up, and medication reconciliation activities were most likely to be effective. Medication reconciliation activities are particularly important as having incorrect information can lead to inappropriate transitions of care and is a significant cause of rehospitalizations among older adults (<link target-id="fig-00002" document="m00346"/>).</para>

    </section>
    <section id="sect-00007">
    <title>Access to Care after Discharge</title>
    <para id="para-00015">Caregivers must ensure that clients have access to necessary medications and durable medical equipment such as nebulizers, walkers, wheelchairs, and home oxygen. It’s also crucial for clients to properly fill, pick up, and take their medications. Weir et al. (2020) found that almost half of all clients were not adherent to some or all changes made to their medications at hospital discharge. Additionally, Weir et al. (2020) also found that clients who were not adherent to any of their medication changes had a significantly higher risk of adverse events compared to those who were adherent to all changes.</para>
    <para id="para-00016">Access to a pharmacy is also important for clients to adhere to their medication regimen after discharge. Research has shown that fewer clients obtained their medications when given a prescription compared to when they were given the medications directly during a hospital visit. There are programs that aim to improve medication access and reduce readmission rates. For example, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">Medication REACH</term> program provided uninsured clients with free medications for the first 30 days after discharge. A study conducted at Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia found that clients in the program had a lower readmission rate compared to those in the control group (American Society of Health-System Pharmacists and American Pharmacists Association, 2013).</para>
    <para id="para-00017">Some health care facilities have started delivering medications to clients at their bedside before discharge (Katz et al., 2020). This approach, along with follow-up phone calls a few days later, has been found to significantly reduce readmission rates compared to standard care (Katz et al., 2020). Bedside medication delivery can help overcome initial barriers to medication access and address any insurance or medication-related issues before the client leaves the hospital.</para>
    </section>
    <section id="sect-00008">
    <title>Communication of Health Care Information</title>
    <para id="para-00018">Sharing health care information with clients and their families can be challenging due to various factors like physical limitations (e.g., hearing, vision, or cognitive impairments) and low health literacy. It’s important to note that only around 12 percent of Americans have a high level of health literacy, and more than one-third struggle with basic health tasks, such as understanding prescription labels (Lopez et al., 2022). Individuals with poor health literacy or cognitive impairments may have difficulty reading and comprehending written health information. This can lead to problems like not following discharge instructions or medication regimens as well as failing to follow up with health care providers after leaving the hospital.</para>
    <para id="para-00019">To address these challenges, health care providers and CHNs should allocate sufficient time to interact with clients and identify any barriers they may face, such as low health literacy or cognitive deficits. This allows providers to find effective ways to overcome these barriers and improve communication with these clients.</para>
    </section>
    <section id="sect-00009">
    <title>Follow-Up Telephone Calls and Home Visits</title>
    <para id="para-00020">Programs like Medication REACH and BOOST have introduced follow-up telephone calls to improve transitions of care. These calls focus on important aspects like the client’s medication list, any side effects experienced, their overall health, and any challenges they face in filling their prescriptions. The timing of these calls varies, ranging from 24 to 72 hours after discharge. The aim is to promptly address client needs, resolve any issues during the transition between care settings, and assess their ability to self-manage their health. However, a systematic review found that follow-up telephone calls alone didn’t have a significant impact on readmission rates (Crocker et al., 2012). Van Spall et al. (2019) found that making the follow-up part of a patient-centered intervention that included follow-up calls, nurse-led home visits, and interprofessional clinics were associated with a reduction in readmissions and death in heart failure clients.</para>
    <para id="para-00021">Many programs, including the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">Veterans Affairs (VA)</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020">Accountable Care Organizations (ACO)</term>, have also adopted post-discharge home visits by different health care providers (Pedersen et al., 2017). These visits allow providers to monitor vital signs, check laboratory test results, manage medication usage, provide additional health education, and identify new problems. Additionally, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00021">telehealth</term> services (or telemedicine) can remotely monitor a client’s health status at home and transmit this information to health care providers. This enables adjustments to drug regimens as necessary, potentially preventing rehospitalizations. Srivastava et al. (2019) found that personalized and client-centered home telehealth monitoring in heart failure clients was successful in reducing admissions without an increase in outpatient visits or hospital readmission in VA clients (<link target-id="fig-00003" document="m00346"/>). During the COVID-19 pandemic, studies highlighted a novel and sustained shift to telehealth that they found reduced barriers to accessing high-value services for older adults during transition periods like discharge to home (Anderson et al., 2021).</para>

    <title>Strategies to Improve Safety and Continuity of Care for Vulnerable Clients</title>
    <para id="para-00022">Care coordination is a critical aspect of health care for vulnerable clients, particularly those with behavioral health needs and those in need of end-of-life/palliative care. Effective care coordination strategies are essential to ensure that these clients receive timely and appropriate services that meet their unique needs. Strategies such as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00022">collaborative care models</term>, care teams, and the use of EHRs can help facilitate effective care coordination, ultimately resulting in improved outcomes for vulnerable clients.</para>
    <para id="para-00023">Clients transitioning for end-of-life or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00023">palliative care</term> services require specialized care that addresses their physical, emotional, and spiritual needs. Effective care coordination for these clients involves ensuring access to appropriate services, including <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">hospice</term> care, counseling services, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00025">pain management</term>. It also involves identifying and addressing cultural and spiritual needs to ensure that care is provided in a compassionate and respectful manner (Reeves et al., 2020).</para>
    <para id="para-00024">Transitional care for <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00026">behavioral health</term> discharges poses a challenge due to the vulnerable period that clients experience during the transition from acute mental health inpatient to community care. Clients discharged from behavioral health hospitals may experience additional risks and anxiety during this period as they adjust to new environments and face potential challenges in accessing follow-up care. Additionally, clients with mental health conditions may have complex care needs that require specialized support and resources, which may not be readily available in the community.</para>
    <para id="para-00025"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00027">Evidence-based discharge planning</term> for behavioral health clients involves using strategies that have been shown to improve client outcomes and reduce readmissions. This includes conducting a comprehensive needs assessment, collaborating with clients and their families to develop a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">client-centered care plan</term>, coordinating care and services with community providers, and ensuring timely follow-up appointments and communication between inpatient and outpatient providers (National Institute of Mental Health, 2019).</para>
    <para id="para-00026">Effective <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029">discharge planning</term> also involves providing clients with education and resources to manage their condition, including medication management and crisis support, and involving family members or other caregivers in the transition process (National Alliance for Suicide Prevention, 2019). Research has shown that evidence-based discharge planning can improve client outcomes and reduce readmissions for clients with mental health conditions (Pincus et al., 2016). By providing clients with the support and resources they need to manage their condition, evidence-based discharge planning can help clients successfully transition from inpatient to outpatient care and improve their overall quality of life.</para>

    <title>Quality Through Care Coordination and Transition Management</title>
    <para id="para-00027">The main goal of transitional care models is to create a care plan that meets the specific needs of each client and provides continuous care across different settings. This involves organizing practical arrangements, educating clients and their families, and coordinating services during transitions.</para>
    <para id="para-00028">Nurses are often at the forefront of quality improvement initiatives. They can actively participate in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00030">interprofessional teams</term>, contribute to the development of care protocols and standards, and provide valuable feedback based on their firsthand experiences. Nurses are directly responsible for monitoring and assessing clients and performing immediate interventions to reduce risk or prevent medical complications. Nurses also oversee other care providers, such as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00031">certified nursing assistants (CNAs)</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00032">licensed practical nurses (LPNs)</term>, patient care technicians, caregivers, and more. A nurse educates clients and family members regarding post-hospital care before discharge. Nurses’ keen observations and drive for client safety at each of these intersections can contribute to quality improvement.</para>
    <para id="para-00029">Quality improvement initiatives around transitions of care must be interprofessional and can be led by nurses. The areas for improvement can be around the care planning and include the following steps that could be optimized.</para>
    <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00004">
    <item>Assessment: The transitional care nurse, who specializes in caring for clients with chronic conditions like heart disease, stroke, COPD, cancer, and diabetes, begins by evaluating the client's health status and behaviors, the level of care and support needed, and their health goals.</item>
    <item>Accumulating Data: The nurse collects all the necessary information and enters it into the health care provider's electronic medication administration record (eMAR) system. This data is used to develop a personalized care plan for the client.</item>
    <item>Access: Authorized health care professionals like doctors, nurses, and social workers can access the care plan to provide daily care based on evidence-based nursing practices to ensure the client's optimal health upon discharge.</item>
    <item>Appointments: The transitional care nurse continues to provide care even after the client leaves the hospital. This includes home visits or remote appointments for about 12 sessions, ensuring a smooth transition from the hospital to the home environment.</item>
    <item>Adjustments: The nurse remains available via telephone for clients and their families to seek additional medical advice when needed. This is crucial for identifying changes in the client's health condition and making necessary adjustments to their care.</item>

    <title>Collaborative Approaches in Coordinating Care</title>
    <para id="para-00040">A collaborative approach in coordinating care with other health care professionals and stakeholders is essential to improve client outcomes and quality of care. Collaboration involves the integration of knowledge, skills, and expertise from multiple health care providers, including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and other allied health professionals. According to Reeves et al. (2017), collaboration in health care requires a shared understanding of client needs, effective communication, mutual trust, and respect among health care providers.</para>
    <para id="para-00041">One example of a collaborative approach in health care coordination is the use of interprofessional teams. Interprofessional teams involve health care providers from different disciplines working together to provide comprehensive care to clients. According to Bachynsky (2019), interprofessional teams can improve client outcomes, reduce health care costs, and enhance the quality of care. Interprofessional teams can include physicians, nurses, pharmacists, social workers, and other health care professionals who work collaboratively to develop and implement care plans for clients (<link target-id="fig-00004" document="m00346"/>).</para>
