<para id="para-00002">Antiplatelet drugs work by decreasing platelet activation and/or platelet adhesion. They are used for various indications including prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease and prevention of ischemic stroke. One of the most common uses for antiplatelets is therapy after a client has an acute coronary syndrome and/or a coronary artery stent placed.</para>
<section id="sect-00003">
<title>Antiplatelet Drugs</title>
<para id="para-00003">There are many antiplatelet drugs available. They will be discussed as grouped by mechanism of action.</para>
<section id="sect-00004">
<title>Aspirin</title>
<para id="para-00004">Aspirin is an over-the-counter antiplatelet agent used for many indications. Some of those indications are secondary prevention of stroke, coronary artery disease, acute coronary syndromes, primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, and prevention of thromboembolism in clients with certain heart valves. It also has anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, which allow it to be used for pain, inflammatory conditions, and fever. Aspirin works as an antiplatelet agent by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase enzyme in platelets, which is responsible for production of prostaglandin precursors of thromboxane A2. Thromboxane A2 is a substance that activates platelets. Aspirin should not be routinely used in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">pediatric clients</term> due to the risk of Reye syndrome. Like all antiplatelet agents, bleeding is a concerning side effect. However, in addition to the effect on platelets, aspirin can also increase the risk of gastric ulcer formation through inhibition of gastric prostaglandin synthesis. Subsequently, gastrointestinal effects are a major adverse effect, and it has additive gastrointestinal bleeding risk beyond its antiplatelet effect.</para>
<note class="clinical-tip" id="note-00001">
<title>Chew Aspirin for Faster Absorption</title>
<para id="para-00005">If acute effects of aspirin are needed, such as during a heart attack, it is recommended that aspirin be chewed and swallowed for faster absorption (Mayo Clinic, n.d.).</para>

<section id="sect-00005">
<title>P2Y12 Inhibitors</title>
<para id="para-00006"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">P2Y12 inhibitors</term> are potent antiplatelet agents that work as antagonists at the P2Y12 subunit of the ADP receptor on the platelet surface, which decreases platelet activation at the site of vessel injury. Because of their effect on bleeding, it is recommended that P2Y12 inhibitors be discontinued 5–7 days prior to surgery, depending on the agent. There are currently four P2Y12 inhibitors available in the United States: clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor, and cangrelor. P2Y12 inhibitors require a loading dose if immediate therapeutic effect is needed (e.g., in an acute myocardial infarction). Onset is slower without loading doses.</para>
<para id="para-00007">Clopidogrel is a prodrug, meaning it must be metabolized to become biologically active. This activation is accomplished through the enzyme CYP2C19. This is significant because clients can have a genetic alteration in this enzyme that inhibits clopidogrel activation, which could lead to therapeutic failure. It is also important because it confers drug interactions. If clients without any genetic alteration take a concomitant drug that inhibits CYP2C19, the enzyme will not be available to activate clopidogrel, which could lead to therapeutic failure.</para>
<note class="safety-alert" id="note-00002">
<title>Clopidogrel</title>
<para id="para-00009">Clopidogrel requires a loading dose if immediate onset is desired, such as during an acute coronary syndrome. Initiating clopidogrel without a loading dose will result in a delayed effect up to several days, putting the client at risk for a thromboembolic event.</para>
</note>
<para id="para-00010">Ticagrelor and prasugrel are two additional oral P2Y12 inhibitors that are stronger in their antiplatelet effect compared to clopidogrel. Prasugrel is a prodrug that must be activated in the body, but it does not rely on CYP2C19 for activation, so it is less susceptible to drug interactions or therapeutic failure due to genetics. However, prasugrel has a comparatively higher risk of bleeding and the highest risk of fatal bleeding of these agents. It is also contraindicated in clients with a history of a stroke or transient ischemic attack, clients who are older than 75 years of age unless they are at very high risk of thromboembolism, and clients who weigh less than 60 kg.</para>
<para id="para-00011">Ticagrelor does not require activation, so like prasugrel, it is not susceptible to CYP2C19-mediated drug interactions or genetic polymorphisms. A noteworthy side effect of ticagrelor is dyspnea, which can limit activities of daily living. It also has a boxed warning from the FDA regarding concomitant aspirin doses, which should not exceed 100 mg orally per day. It is contraindicated in clients with a history of intracranial hemorrhage.</para>
<para id="para-00012">Cangrelor is the only intravenous P2Y12 inhibitor. It is approved for use during percutaneous coronary intervention. The advantage of cangrelor is that it inhibits platelets nearly immediately upon administration, and platelet function recovers within an hour of medication discontinuation.</para>

<section id="sect-00006">
<title>Eptifibatide</title>
<para id="para-00013"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">Eptifibitide</term> inhibits the GPIIbIIIa receptor on the platelet surface, preventing activation by von Willebrand’s factor and fibrinogen. This receptor is responsible for the final step in platelet-to-platelet adhesion; thus, this is a very potent antiplatelet agent. It is FDA approved for use during percutaneous coronary intervention in clients experiencing a non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome. The major side effect of eptifibatide is profound thrombocytopenia. Nurses should monitor the client’s platelet count closely and discontinue eptifibatide if the platelet count decreases to under 100,000/mm<sup>3</sup>.</para>

<title>Adverse Effects and Contraindications</title>
<para id="para-00015">Like anticoagulants, the major side effect of all antiplatelet medications is bleeding complications. This can manifest in many different ways, including excessive bleeding in response to trauma or during surgery, gastrointestinal bleeding, or spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage. Some symptoms of bleeding are blood in the stool; dark, tarry-appearing stools; blood in the urine; epistaxis; gingival bleeding; very severe headache; coffee-ground emesis; and hemoptysis.</para>
<para id="para-00016">A history of bleeding complications, such as intracranial hemorrhage or gastrointestinal bleeding, may be considered a contraindication to further antiplatelet therapy, depending on the circumstances and the drug. Concomitant medications that further increase bleeding risk such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., ibuprofen and naproxen) or antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin) may also be considered contraindicated with antiplatelet medications.</para>
