<para id="para-00002">The terms <emphasis effect="italics">health promotion</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">disease prevention</emphasis> are often used together to describe a mechanism for improving health outcomes. Although the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (USDHHS) (n.d.b) Healthy People 2030 initiative states that “promoting health and well-being and preventing disease are linked efforts that encompass physical, mental, and social health dimensions” (para. 6), health promotion and disease prevention are two individual processes. Though their functions overlap, it is necessary to examine each as a separate and distinct entity.</para>
<section id="sect-00002">
<title>A Closer Look at Health Promotion</title>
<para id="para-00003">Organizations define health promotion in different ways. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion</term>, described in detail later in this chapter, offers the most widely accepted description of health promotion:</para>
<para id="para-00004"><term id="term-00002">Health promotion</term> is the process of empowering people to increase control over, and to improve, their health (World Health Organization [WHO], 1986). This must involve addressing physical, mental, and social well-being. In order to accomplish health promotion, an individual or group must be able to identify and realize goals related to health, satisfy needs, and change or cope with the environment. Health, according to the WHO (1986), should be seen not as the objective of living but instead as a resource for everyday life. Clearly, health promotion is a responsibility of the health sector. Sectors are critical, distinct parts of society. We must view health promotion as not just the responsibility of the health sector but as an obligation of multiple sectors, such as the environmental, educational, and technological sectors as well as others (WHO, 1986, para. 1).</para>
<para id="para-00005">The process of health promotion includes activities for individuals, the community at large, or for populations at increased risk of negative health outcomes. Health promotion is empowering for individuals and communities, and it can be used in both active and passive ways. For instance, adding fluoride to public drinking water is a passive form of health promotion at the community level. Brushing teeth and getting regular dental assessments are active forms of health promotion at the individual level.</para>
<section id="sect-00003">
<title>Health Promotion Behaviors</title>
<para id="para-00006">Health promotion behaviors aim to improve the well-being, mental health, and quality of life of individuals and communities (Walker et al., 1995; see <link target-id="table-00001" document="m00179"/>). There are <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">six dimensions of health promotion behaviors</term> that describe certain behaviors by which a person engages with their health. These dimensions empower (or not) a person’s control over and improvement of their health.</para>

<title>Nurses’ Role in Health Promotion</title>
<para id="para-00007">As mentioned above, health promotion is often an <term id="term-00005">intersectoral</term> endeavor (WHO, 2023a)—that is, one that involves several sectors of society and that can occur within or outside of the health care sector. Actions taken by health, education, housing, and local government sectors collaborating to enhance population health use an intersectoral approach (Oxford, 2023). Because nurses can serve in a variety of roles in interprofessional practice, including care provider, educator, consultant, and advocate, they are in a unique position to contribute to intersectoral collaboration. Health promotion can involve the following:</para>
<list id="list-00002">
<item>Assisting a client in developing personal health promotion behavior skills (individual)</item>
<item>Assisting the community in strengthening actions to achieve better health (community)</item>
<item>Creating supportive environments within society (population or public as a whole)</item>
<item>Advocating for the adoption of public health policies (population or public as a whole)</item>
</list>
<para id="para-00008">Throughout the health promotion process, as nurses assist clients in developing personal health promotion behavior skills, they serve as care providers and educators. Assessment data may indicate the need to develop a client’s personal health promotion behaviors. The nurse assumes the role of educator during the implementation stage. Effective education for change requires the nurse to have a good grasp of evidence-based practice and other scientific knowledge as well as educational theory, the teaching-learning process, and models specifically related to health behavior change (see <link document="m00181">Theories and Models</link>). The nurse must support individual, and therefore social, development by educating, informing, and improving clients’ life skills (WHO, 2023c). When a client is informed and knowledgeable, they have the ability to make choices that can positively influence their health and their environment (WHO, 2023c). The nurse educates the client about their current situation and provides anticipatory guidance to help them meet and cope with health challenges as they move through the stages of the lifespan (WHO, 2023c). The role of the nurse as an educator is one of the most critical roles in health promotion. The nurse may also need to serve as educator in order to create supportive environments for health.</para>
<para id="para-00009">The nurse serves as consultant and advocate by performing community health promotion activities. Such activities strengthen clients’ actions to achieve better health, resulting in environments that support better health (Iriarte-Roteta et al., 2020). A community is complex, frequently changing, and made up of interconnecting parts from which health cannot be separated. Planners can seek input from a public health nurse to understand the health and illness experiences of the community and implement beneficial changes for community health (American Public Health Association [APHA], 2022). For instance, a city council may request input from a public health nurse prior to installing a new splash park for children.</para>
<para id="para-00010">Nurses have a responsibility to advocate for access to health care, health promotion, disease prevention, and any other health-related issues. A variety of professional groups, including the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">American Nurses Association</term> (ANA, 2015), the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">American Association of Colleges of Nursing</term> (2021), and the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">International Council of Nurses</term> (2021), support the nurse’s role as policy advocate. According to the ANA (n.d.), “Advocacy is a pillar of nursing.”</para>

<section id="sect-00005">
<title>A Closer Look at Disease Prevention</title>
<para id="para-00011"><term id="term-00009">Disease prevention</term> involves undertaking specific population- and individual-based interventions geared toward decreasing the burden of both communicable and noncommunicable diseases and their associated risk factors (WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean, 2023). The hallmark of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">communicable diseases</term> is that they spread from one person to another, from an animal to a person, or from a surface or a food to a person (CDC, 2022). They may include pandemics and infectious disease outbreaks, vaccine-preventable diseases, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), viral hepatitis, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), tuberculosis (TB), and others (see <link document="m00167">Pandemics and Infectious Disease Outbreaks</link>). The CDC (2022) broadly defines <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">noncommunicable diseases</term> as chronic conditions that do not result from an acute or infectious process. Chronic diseases are those that meet one or both of the following criteria: a disease that lasts one year or longer and requires ongoing medical attention; a disease that limits the activities of daily living. Noncommunicable diseases include chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and others, as discussed in <link document="m00118">The Health of the Population</link>.</para>
<section id="sect-00006">
<title>Preventive Care</title>
<para id="para-00012">Another term for disease prevention is preventive care. According to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS, n.d.), <term id="term-00012">preventive care</term> involves routine health care screenings, check-ups, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">immunizations</term>, and counseling to prevent illness, disease, or health-related problems. Healthy People 2030: Preventive Care gives examples and connects preventive care to the Healthy People 2030 Objectives, as described in detail in <link document="m00192">Planning Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Interventions</link>.</para>

<title>Nurses’ Role in Disease Prevention</title>
<para id="para-00014">Nurses play an enormous role in disease prevention. The nurse’s role as educator is especially important to prevention, as nurses are qualified to provide information, training, and education about a range of health-related, preventive topics. When people are educated about health behaviors, they experience better health outcomes (Zajacova &amp; Lawrence, 2018).</para>
<para id="para-00015">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion</term> (NCCDPHP, 2023), a branch of the CDC, indicates that 6 in 10 Americans live with at least one chronic disease. These largely preventable diseases are the leading causes of death and disability in the United States. For instance, tobacco use can lead to several forms of cancer. Diets high in sodium can lead to hypertension. Preventive care such as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">smoking cessation</term> and dietary education can help prevent these chronic diseases from occurring. Nurses can educate their clients about these and other disease-preventing behavior changes. Recall Deanna from the case scenario. The nurse at the community health screening helped to identify a potential chronic health problem for Deanna and then provided Deanna with information she could use to help prevent the development or progression of hypertension.</para>
<para id="para-00016">Nurses apply <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">evidence-based practice</term> to prevent disease (see <link document="m00154">Evidence-Based Practice</link>). Using evidence from correlational or causal studies to examine the relationships between diseases and behaviors or risks for these diseases, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">U.S. Preventive Services Task Force</term> (USPSTF, 2021) <link url="https://openstax.org/r/uspreventiv">makes recommendations about</link> the effectiveness of clinical primary and secondary preventive services based on available evidence. These recommendations inform effective nursing practice. For example, nurses may inform clients of USPSTF recommendations for colorectal cancer screenings in adults and older adults, tobacco smoking cessation in adults, and the use of folic acid in pregnant persons for the prevention of neural tube defects.</para>

<title>The Distinction Between Health Promotion and Disease Prevention</title>
<para id="para-00017">While the functions of health promotion and disease prevention overlap and they share many goals, there are differences between the two. Disease prevention focuses on specific efforts at reducing the development and severity of chronic diseases and other morbidities. While health promotion efforts can lead to such a reduction, health promotion can also occur unlinked to disease and simply be used to promote overall well-being. Some examples of health promotion that is unlinked to prevention of a specific disease may include the following:</para>
<list id="list-00003">
<item>Physical activity campaigns to encourage regular exercise</item>
<item><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">Nutrition</term> education regarding balanced diets and portion control</item>
<item><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">Stress management</term> workshops to enhance mental well-being</item>
<item>Workplace wellness programs to support employees’ physical and mental health</item>
<item>Smoking cessation programs to promote a smoke-free environment</item>
<item>Mental health awareness campaigns to reduce stigma</item>
<item><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020">Environmental health</term> initiatives to promote clean air, clean water, and safe living</item>
</list>
<para id="para-00018">Another distinction between health promotion and disease prevention is related to the strategies used for each. Health promotion interventions often involve education, awareness campaigns, behavior change programs, and community engagement to encourage healthy behaviors and create supportive environments for health. On the other hand, disease prevention strategies more specifically target known risk factors or disease processes.</para>
<para id="para-00019">Another distinction often occurs at the conceptual level. In this case, health promotion is primarily concerned with the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00021">social determinants of health</term> (SDOH) (WHO, 2023a). SDOH, as described in <link document="m00140">Social Determinants Affecting Health Outcomes</link>, are “the conditions in the environments where people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship and age that affect a wide range of health, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes and risks” (USDHHS, n.d.c). Therefore, various sectors typically collaborate with the health care sector to contribute to addressing SDOH. For example, the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean (2023) describes the collaboration of the governmental sector (policy development), the tobacco manufacturing sector, the education sector, and the health care sector in combating tobacco use. Disease prevention, in contrast, has primarily been concentrated within the health care sector (WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean, 2023).</para>

    <title>Chapter Summary</title>
<para id="para-00020">Health promotion and disease prevention are overlapping yet distinct processes. Both are foundational principles that guide the Healthy People 2030 initiative. Best defined by the Ottawa Charter, health promotion is the process of enabling people to increase control over, and to improve, their health. The six dimensions of health promotion behaviors include responsibility, physical activity, nutrition, interpersonal relations, spiritual growth, and stress management. Disease prevention involves undertaking specific interventions geared toward decreasing the burden of disease and its associated risk factors. Preventive care, including screenings, immunizations, check-ups, and counseling, are a large portion of prevention. Nurses play an important role in both health promotion and disease prevention.</para>
