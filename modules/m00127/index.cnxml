<title>Availability of Health Care Services</title>
<para id="para-00003">The availability of health care services and health care providers may be limited or absent, depending on where an individual lives. This is especially true for people who live in rural areas where the distance to the nearest clinic, hospital, or provider may be great and transportation to reach health care services may be a barrier related to cost or availability. Many rural regions of the United States have been experiencing severe shortages of primary care providers for decades (Rural Health Information Hub [RHIH], 2023), exacerbating health disparities as individuals without reasonable access to health care providers and services cannot adequately address health conditions or receive preventive care, such as screenings (CDC, 2022g).</para>
<para id="para-00004">Mental health care is essential to a population’s health, yet there are additional barriers to accessing these services—particularly for <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">disadvantaged groups</term>. “<term id="term-00003">Mental health</term> includes a person’s emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, act, handle stress, relate to others, and make choices” (CDC, 2022c). The cost of mental health services has continued to rise in the United States over the last decade. According to Harvard Pilgrim Health Care (2023), “even prior to the pandemic in 2019, the cost of mental health treatment and services reached $225 billion, up 52 percent from 10 years earlier.”</para>
<para id="para-00005">Ethnic minorities experience greater mental health disparities than the rest of the population (CDC, 2023c). This is often related to limited access to health care services as well as stigma and discrimination, which may prevent individuals from comfortably seeking care. <term id="term-00004">Stigma</term> is shaming or disgrace attached to an individual’s circumstance, background, personal traits, or associations. Often the result of ignorance or fear, stigmatization involves negative attitudes and beliefs toward people, which can also lead to discrimination (APA, 2023; Mayo Clinic, 2017). This stigma is especially acute in minority communities. For some populations, such as ethnic minorities and those struggling with chronic diseases, access to mental health services is especially difficult. For example, ethnic minorities tend to live in areas that lack treatment facilities and health care providers qualified to offer mental health services (CDC, 2022g). In addition, stigma related to mental illness tends to prevent individuals from seeking care (Mayo Clinic, 2017). The combination of stigma and limited access to health care services means that individuals living with mental illness may not seek care until their disease process has advanced to the point that more expensive treatments or even institutionalization are required, which drives up the cost of caring for an individual living with a mental illness. <link document="m00348">Caring for Populations and Communities in Crisis</link> provides more information on mental health.</para>

<section id="sect-00004">
<title>Consumer Confidence</title>
<para id="para-00006">Consumer confidence refers to how individuals feel about health care services and providers. Confidence in the health care system can be compromised. For example, a history of structural racism and discrimination in the U.S. may lead members of some communities, such as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">communities of color</term>, to distrust the health care system. People who distrust the system tend to avoid seeking the care they need to address health conditions, such as chronic diseases (CDC, 2022f; 2022g). Individuals who are concerned that they will not be able to communicate effectively with health care providers or navigate the complexities of the health care system due to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">language barriers</term>, low <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">health literacy</term>, or both may be reluctant to seek care (RHIH, 2022). Consumer loyalty refers to an ongoing emotional relationship between an organization and its customers. Customers loyal to an organization tend to support its mission and utilize its services (Oracle, 2023). Based on this definition of customer loyalty and consumer confidence, it is possible to conclude that mistrust in the health care system may prevent individuals from seeking care, potentially further exacerbating health disparities (CDC, 2022g).</para>
<para id="para-00007">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">COVID-19</term> pandemic highlighted the longstanding issue of a lack of trust in the health care system among ethnic minorities and other underrepresented populations, resulting in vaccine hesitancy, despite higher rates of COVID-19 infections, deaths, and hospitalizations among this demographic (Shearn &amp; Krockow, 2023). The rapid development of the COVID-19 vaccine caused many communities—such as Black, Hispanic, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">immigrant</term> communities—to grow increasingly distrustful of the health care system, because of a history of unethical research practices in which minorities were mistreated. This significantly increased the level of anxiety among these groups and made many less likely to get vaccinated (Baker, 2020). A systematic review of the literature by Shearn &amp; Kockrow (2023) attributed three main themes related to COVID-19 <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">vaccine hesitancy</term> among ethnic and racial minority populations: institutional mistrust, lack of confidence in the vaccine development process, and lack of reliable information or messengers. In addition to the general history of racism and discrimination encountered by this population, many are aware of a history of previous mistreatment and unethical research practices by medical researchers, such as bias in assigning minorities to study groups in clinical trials. For this reason, some equated the rapid development of the COVID-19 vaccine with fears about medical experimentation, sterilization, or eradication. Individuals who reside in the United States without legal documentation expressed concerns that data related to their vaccination would be shared with immigration enforcement (Shearn &amp; Kockrow, 2023; Rusoja &amp; Thomas, 2021).</para>

<title>Health Care Costs and Consumer Behavior</title>
<para id="para-00008">Cost determines if an individual can afford to pay for health care services. Those with limited income often must choose between health care and basic needs such as food and shelter. In this situation, they may choose not to seek health care services altogether, which further exacerbates health disparities related to chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and obesity (CDC, 2022g).</para>
<section id="sect-00006">
<title>Cost of Health Insurance</title>
<para id="para-00009">Health care costs impact the behavior of individuals who lack the means to pay for health care services. For example, ethnic minorities, such as Hispanic and Black clients, tend to have higher rates of uninsured than their White counterparts. This is especially true of individuals living in rural and urban areas and of the “working poor,” individuals who do not make enough money to purchase health insurance, but who make too much money to qualify for Medicaid (Commonwealth Fund, 2021). When individuals lack the means to pay for health care services, their use of health care services tends to decrease, which leads to more negative health outcomes for the client.</para>
</section>
<section id="sect-00007">
<title>Cost of Prescription Drugs</title>
<para id="para-00010">The cost of prescription medications also affects consumer behavior. Prescription drug prices have risen steadily in the last two decades in the United States. According to a report by the AARP, every year since 2006, the cost of specialty prescription drugs has increased at a rate that far exceeds the general inflation rate (2021). Such specialty medications are used to treat cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and other conditions and are used widely by older adults. according to a report by AARP. Approximately three in 10 adults report not taking their medications as prescribed due to cost (Kirzinger et al., 2023). Among this group, 21 percent did not fill the prescription, 21 percent took an over-the-counter medication instead of getting the prescription filled, and 12 percent reported cutting the pills in half or skipping doses to save costs. Other common strategies clients use to decrease drug costs include using generic drugs, asking the health care provider to prescribe a different medication (a less expensive alternative, a higher dose that can be split in half, or a different form of the drug—a cream instead of a gel for example), or trying alternative therapies (CDC, 2019b).</para>

<section id="sect-00008">
<title>Cost of Delaying Care</title>
<para id="para-00011">According to the CDC (2022g), racial and ethnic minorities tend to be impacted by disease at greater levels than their White counterparts. The same can be said of older adults, who tend to have more health issues than their younger counterparts. In many cases—because of the cost of, mistrust in, or lack of easy access to health care services and providers in their communities—individuals may wait until their disease is more advanced before they seek health care. For example, a person may not receive care during prediabetes but may then be impacted by kidney failure secondary to diabetes, which is far more expensive than preventing or even managing diabetes before it has damaged the kidneys.</para>
<para id="para-00012">The COVID-19 pandemic also ushered in a time of economic challenges. Job losses peaked during the pandemic, especially for minority populations who worked in low-paying industries impacted by pandemic-caused closures (Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 2022). These job losses coincided with a rise in health care costs, which exacerbated the tendency of many ethnic minorities to not seek health care, contributing to negative health outcomes among groups who were already struggling before the arrival of the pandemic.</para>
</section>
<section id="sect-00009">
<title>Cost of Disease Care</title>
<para id="para-00013">Ethnic minorities and older adults may also be more likely to be the recipients of public health insurance programs such as Medicaid and Medicare. The types and severity of health conditions experienced by these demographics make health care costs covered by government insurance programs even greater. For example, as the percentage of older adults in the United States. grows, the dollars paid by Medicare will continue to rise. This is especially true as the large numbers of aging baby boomers become eligible for Medicare at age 65.</para>
<para id="para-00014">When individuals lack adequate health insurance, they tend to use hospital emergency departments more frequently ([link]<emphasis effect="bold">Figure 5.4</emphasis>[/link]) (Udalova et al., 2022). Laws prevent health care organizations from turning clients away when they present to the emergency department. When individuals lack health insurance, health care organizations may have to provide <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">uncompensated care</term>, which leads to increased costs for the facility (American Hospital Association, 2023c). Individuals from underrepresented communities and those with lower incomes tend to use an emergency department for preventable care more than their counterparts in other communities (Udalova et al., 2022). Thus, the cost of paying for health insurance for underrepresented populations leads these populations to use the emergency department for services best addressed in another setting (Udalova et al., 2022).</para>

<para id="para-00016">According to Healthy People 2030, there were approximately 9,325 emergency department visits for nonfatal injuries per 100,000 people in 2017. To address this issue, Healthy People 2030 established a goal to reduce the number of visits for nonfatal injuries to approximately 7,711 per 100,000 people by 2030. The most recent data from 2020 show this goal has been exceeded.</para>

<title>Chapter Summary</title>
<para id="para-00017">Factors that affect health care consumer behavior include cost, availability of services and providers, and degrees of consumer confidence in those services and providers. Consumer behavior affects health care costs. For example, populations that tend to neglect health care until chronic diseases and mental health disorders become severe are more costly to treat than preventive care would have been. This also pushes up the price of costly prescriptions needed to treat advanced health conditions. Conversely, the high cost of health care and health care insurance prevents consumers from using health care services. Many consumers turn to emergency department visits because hospitals by law cannot turn away clients. If the client is unable to pay, the hospital bears the cost of care given, thereby further increasing the cost of health care overall. As the face of America continues to change, how individuals as consumers interact with the health care system will increasingly be a factor that must be addressed.</para>
