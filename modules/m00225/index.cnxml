<title>Integrating Cultural Humility</title>
<para id="para-00003">As discussed in <link document="m00213"><emphasis effect="bold">Culturally and Linguistically Responsive Nursing Care</emphasis></link>, cultural humility emphasizes self-awareness, self-reflection, and a willingness to learn from and engage with individuals from different cultural backgrounds. Moreover, cultural humility goes beyond competency, emphasizing a continuous process of self-reflection and self-awareness. Nurses who practice cultural humility approach each interaction as an opportunity to learn, appreciating that they may not always have the answers but can always seek better to comprehend the nuances of another person’s cultural background. Cultural humility promotes effective health care interactions through a process of lifelong self-reflection and learning (Tervalon, 1998).</para>
<para id="para-00004">The framework for cultural humility is based on two models: <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">The Process of Cultural Competence in Healthcare</term> (Campinha-Bacote, 2011) and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">A Biblically Based Model of Cultural Competence</term> (Campinha-Bacote, 2013). The models form the foundation for cultural competemility. Campinha-Bacote (2018) defines cultural competemility as “the synergistic process between cultural humility and cultural competence in which cultural humility permeates each of the five components of cultural competence: cultural awareness, cultural knowledge, cultural skill, cultural desire, and cultural encounters” (<link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00225"/>) (Campinha-Bacote, 2018). <term id="term-00004">Conscious permeability</term> emerges when individuals actively apply cultural humility in their daily lives and interactions. It involves acknowledging that cultural competence is a continuous journey rather than a destination. Conscious permeability enables individuals to be flexible and adapt their behavior, communication style, and decision making in response to different cultural contexts.</para>

<para id="para-00005">Campinha-Bacote (2019) contends that for nurses to enhance their journey towards cultural competemility, they must humbly consider, “Have I ASKED myself the right questions?” The A-S-K-E-D mnemonic represents self-examination questions regarding one’s cultural awareness, skill, knowledge, encounters, and desire. The components of the mnemonic include:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00002">
<item><emphasis effect="bold">A</emphasis>wareness: Am I aware of my prejudices and biases and the presence of racism and other ‘isms?’</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">S</emphasis>kill: Do I know how to conduct a culturally specific history, physical, mental health, medication, and spiritual assessment in a culturally sensitive manner?</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">K</emphasis>nowledge: Do I have knowledge regarding different cultures’ worldview, the field of biocultural ecology, and the importance of addressing social determinants of health?</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">E</emphasis>ncounters: Do I have sacred and unremitting encounters with people from cultures different from mine, and am I committed to resolving cross-cultural conflicts?</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">D</emphasis>esire: Do I really ‘want to’ engage in the process of competemility?</item>
</list>
<para id="para-00006"><term id="term-00005">Cultural sensitivity</term> in nursing care refers to the awareness, understanding, and consideration of clients and their families’ diverse cultural backgrounds, beliefs, practices, and preferences. It involves providing health care services that respect and accommodate cultural differences, ensuring clients receive care tailored to their needs while maintaining their cultural dignity and values (Leininger, 2002). Cultural sensitivity and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">cultural humility</term> are closely related concepts that work in tandem to promote cultural competency in health care. They both emphasize the importance of recognizing and respecting clients’ diverse cultural backgrounds, beliefs, and practices. Cultural sensitivity serves as a foundation for cultural humility. The initial step allows health care professionals to recognize and appreciate cultural differences. However, cultural humility takes it further by urging individuals to continuously question their assumptions, engage in self-examination, and strive for a deeper understanding of others’ cultures (Tervalon, 1998). Cultural humility builds on cultural sensitivity by promoting curiosity, respect, and a willingness to be corrected or educated by clients about their cultural beliefs. This approach enhances the development of cultural competency, as it encourages health care professionals to collaborate with clients, share power, and foster more effective <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">partnerships</term> in care.</para>

<section id="sect-00004">
<title>Moving from a State of Becoming Aware to a State of Being Aware</title>
<para id="para-00007">The process of fully integrating cultural humility occurs across a continuum from <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">impermeability</term> to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">permeability</term> (Campinha-Bacote, 2018). As nurses progress toward competency, they will move from being unaware of cultural humility to being mindful and spontaneously engaging in it during cultural encounters. For example, some nurses may be at a stage of unawareness known as <term id="term-00010">unconscious impermeability</term>, which refers to a lack of recognition that cultural humility is necessary to become culturally competent. At this stage, the nurse may not be aware of power imbalances that influence care (Campinha-Bacote, 2019). Power imbalances can arise due to various factors, including social status, language fluency, health system familiarity, and previous <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">discrimination</term>. This can impede culturally sensitive care delivery.</para>
<para id="para-00008">Other nurses may be at the stage of <term id="term-00012">conscious impermeability</term>. During this stage, the nurse recognizes the importance of cultural humility but struggles to demonstrate it in practice (Campinha-Bacote, 2018). In contrast, conscious permeability is the mindful act of learning to become culturally humble and use a cultural lens throughout the entire cultural encounter with the client (Campinha-Bacote, 2018). Finally, others may be in a stage of <term id="term-00013">unconscious permeability</term> in which they can spontaneously operate from a place of cultural humility.</para>
<para id="para-00009">These stages represent the process of becoming culturally competent while also practicing cultural humility, moving from a state of becoming aware to a state of being aware. Integrating cultural humility into all aspects of cultural awareness, knowledge, skills, encounters, and desire can lead to unconscious permeability, as shown in <link target-id="table-00001" document="m00225"/>.</para>

<caption>Actions to Promote the Integration of Cultural Humility into the Five Components of Cultural Competence (source: Campinha-Bacote 2011; 2018.)</caption>
</table>
<para id="para-00010">In the journey towards embracing cultural humility, nurses move from a state of being closed off to one of being open and engaged in various cultural interactions. This progression, as outlined by Campinha-Bacote (2018), involves advancing from a state of unawareness to a heightened state of mindfulness. Nurses at different points on this continuum may be situated in stages such as unconscious impermeability, where their cultural humility is still developing. As they advance along this continuum, they gain a deeper understanding of cultural humility, which enhances their ability to provide client-centered care that is respectful, sensitive, and attuned to the diverse needs of individuals and communities.</para>

<title>Chapter Summary</title>
<para id="para-00011">To achieve cultural competency, nurses must respect clients’ values, customs, and beliefs. Cultural competency encompasses various attributes such as cultural awareness, knowledge, skills, encounters, and humility. It is essential to note that cultural humility should not be considered in isolation, but rather in combination with cultural awareness, knowledge, skills, encounters, and desire. Nurses can adopt this approach to develop cultural competence, which ultimately leads to “conscious permeability.”</para>
