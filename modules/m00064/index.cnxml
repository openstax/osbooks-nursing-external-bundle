    <title>Nutrition Requirement for Optimal Pulmonary Health</title>
    <para id="para-00002"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">Lung disease</term> is the umbrella term for several diseases and disorders of the pulmonary system that prohibit the lungs from performing optimally (NIH, 2022b). Lung diseases inhibit and alter respiratory function, breathing capabilities, and lung capacity. Lung diseases vary in etiology. Infectious microorganisms cause some, while others maintain an environmental cause. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">Chronic pulmonary diseases</term> cause long-term breathing problems, drastically impacting a client’s quality of life. These conditions include symptoms of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">cough</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">wheezing</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">shortness of breath</term>. Other common chronic pulmonary diseases include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, and pneumonia. Pulmonary conditions that are not long term include respiratory tract infections and pulmonary embolism.</para>
    <section id="sect-00004">
    <title>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)</title>
    <para id="para-00003">Chronic or long-term lower pulmonary diseases are classified as <term id="term-00006">chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</term> <emphasis effect="bold">(COPD)</emphasis>. The COPD categories include emphysema and chronic bronchitis (Gozzi-Silva et al., 2021; NIH, 2022b; NIH, 2022d). These obstructive diseases are progressive and limit the volume of air that flows into and out of the airways, decreasing gas exchange and making it difficult to breathe (NIH, 2022d). See <link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00064"/>. <term id="term-00007">Emphysema</term> results in damage between the walls of the air sacs, or alveoli, that exchange gas in the lungs (NIH, 2022d; Pahal et al., 2023). Without injury present, the alveoli easily expand and stretch with inhalation and deflate readily with exhalation (Pahal et al., 2023). Emphysema leads to permanent dilation of the airspaces and decreases alveolar and capillary surface area. For example, consider an overinflated balloon that does not maintain the same elasticity over time. The common cause of emphysema is exposure to cigarette smoking and other noxious gases, such as sulfur dioxide (Pahal et al., 2023). <term id="term-00008">Chronic bronchitis</term> is the result of continuous inflammation of the airway linings, causing increasing mucus with clinical manifestations that include a productive cough of at least 2 months occurring within a 2-year timeframe (NIH, 2022b; Widysanto &amp; Mathew, 2023). As with emphysema, cigarette smoking, active or passively, or inhaling toxic chemicals and industrial pollutants is the leading causative factor in developing chronic bronchitis.</para>

    <media alt="A diagram of the stages of C O P D from healthy lungs, to environmentally diseased lungs, to lungs with C O P D. Healthy lungs have an open airway and alveoli that are light colored. The lungs are a uniform shade of pink. Environmentally diseased lungs have an airway that is narrower than normal and alveoli that are slightly darker. The lungs have a few darker colored patches on them. Lungs with C O P D have a severely restricted air way with barely any opening. The alveoli are quite dark and appear hardened. The lungs have many dark spots throughout. The disease begins with inhalation of air pollution and more systematic inflammation causes the closing of the airway. The first line of defense includes oxygen, supplementation, bronchodilators, antibiotics, corticosteroids, antivirals, mucolytics, proper nutrition, smoking cessation, and hydration. Potential complications of C O P D include bacterial virus, and fungal infections and increased smoking and air pollution will continue the damage. Signs and symptoms include anxiety, panic disorders, depression, dyspnea on exertion, and airway inflammation."><image mime-type="image/jpg" src="../../media/NUT_Figure_14_02_003.png"/></media>

    <para id="para-00004">Chronic lung conditions such as COPD severely diminish the quality of life, so individuals should strive to consume foods that promote lung function throughout the chronic diseases states to prevent exacerbations (Collins et al., 2019; NIH, 2022b; NIH, 2022d; Pahal et al., 2023; Scoditti et al., 2019; Widysanto &amp; Mathew, 2022). Exercise is limited in clients with COPD, because they often suffer from dyspnea on exertion as a condition symptom. The lack of exercise is attributed to muscle loss and dysfunction, resulting in fatigue. Even the act of eating might trigger <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">dyspnea</term>, leading to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">anorexia</term>. If a client is faced with the choice between breathing and eating, they will breathe to survive, which why anorexia and malnutrition is a common finding in these clients. As anorexia is present, the risk for significant malnutrition increases while vital vitamin and nutritional depletion continues. The lack of critical nutritional components accelerates respiratory decline as respiratory muscles weaken and cough pressure diminishes. As cough pressure declines, mucosal buildup threatens potential complications such as pneumonia.</para>

    <title>Asthma</title>
    <para id="para-00009"><term id="term-00011">Asthma</term> is a chronic disease clinically characterized by recurrent inflammation and airway narrowing (Gozzi-Silva et al., 2021; Hashmi et al., 2023; NIH, 2022a). These symptoms of chronic inflammation result from irritation from correlated efforts between the respiratory epithelium and both the initial and the (later) adaptive immune responses. Hyperresponsiveness is the reaction of the airway results from the activation of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">granulocytes</term>, such as the eosinophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, and mast cells. The response of the granulocytes triggers the smooth muscle in the airways to contract and secret mucus and also includes microvascular leakages. As the airway swells, gas exchange is prevented, and symptoms such as shortness of breath, dyspnea, cough, and wheezing is present. The disease process is associated with childhood and can carry into adulthood, or it might occur in adulthood. The etiology of asthma relates to allergic and environmental factors such as hay fever, tobacco smoke, particulate matter, pollen, mold, dust mites, food, and eczema. Asthma has no cure, affecting 1 in 13 people in the United States (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022). <link target-id="fig-00002" document="m00064"/> provides a visual of a normal airway with asthmatic and asthma attack airways.</para>

    <title>Pulmonary Fibrosis</title>
    <para id="para-00010">Like scars that develop on the skin, <term id="term-00013">pulmonary fibrosis</term> involves <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">scarring</term> of the lung tissue (Krishna et al., 2022). Scar or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">fibrotic tissue</term> does not function normally in gas exchange. The fibrotic tissue prevents oxygen flow from the alveoli into the bloodstream, leading to low oxygen levels and compromised lung capacity as the scar tissue stiffens. Pulmonary fibrosis etiology might be idiopathic or secondary to another illness, medication, radiation therapy, or environmental exposure (Agarwal &amp; Huda, 2022; Krishna et al., 2022).</para>
    <para id="para-00011">Nutritional intake significantly impacts clinical outcomes for individuals with pulmonary fibrosis. Nutrients are in high demand due to the increase in respiratory workload, activation of inflammatory mediators, hypoxemia, and lack of physical exercise (Faverio et al., 2020). As with COPD, malnutrition remains prevalent for those with inadequate nutrition intake. Some preferred treatment medications for pulmonary fibrosis cause diarrhea and other adverse effects such as food malabsorption. Specific dietary counseling by a registered dietitian is recommended for those who experience these effects.</para>

RTIs are commonly acquired viral infections. These infections manifest in either the lower tract as pneumonia or in the upper tract as bronchitis, rhinitis, sinusitis, otitis, pharyngitis, epiglottitis, and tracheitis. Systemic manifestations include fever, headache, sore throat, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, and myalgia (LaRocque &amp; Ryan, 2019; Saleri &amp; Ryan, 2019). Transmission occurs through direct droplet contact or inhalation (Saleri &amp; Ryan, 2019).

    <title>Pneumonia</title>
    <para id="para-00013"><term id="term-00026">Pneumonia</term> is a condition that leads to inflammation of lung parenchyma caused by infection, chronic pulmonary diseases, ventilator use, or aspiration (NIH, 2022c; Sattar &amp; Sharma, 2022; Sanivarapu &amp; Gibson, 2022). When germs migrate into the lungs, the immune system is activated, causing alveoli and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00027">lung parenchyma inflammation</term>. The inflammation causes the lungs to fill with fluid or pus. When an infection is a cause, the types of pneumonia are classified by acquisition type: community (within 48 hours of hospital admission), hospital-acquired (nonintubated person after 48 hours of hospital admission), ventilation (within 48 hours after intubation), or healthcare-associated (hospitalization within last 3 months) pneumonia. Pneumonia can lead to further chronic complications for some clients, such as lung fibrosis, damaged lung parenchyma, necrotizing pneumonia, cavitation, empyema, abscess, and death (Sattar &amp; Sharma, 2022; Sanivarapu &amp; Gibson, 2022).

A pulmonary embolism <link target-id="fig-00003" document="m00064"/> causes decreased or no blood flow because a blood clot becomes dislodged and migrates to the lungs (Vyas &amp; Goyal, 2022). As <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00030">lipid plaques</term> accumulate on the arterial walls, the body’s inflammation systems activate (Ashrobi et al., 2022). Initial lipid plaques evolve into <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00031">fibrous plaques</term> that activate the release of inflammatory markers and procoagulating factors. The process is known as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00032">atherosclerosis</term>, and the activation of the platelets causes adhesion and aggregation that triggers clot formation. A <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00033">thrombus</term> is a clot formed in a blood vessel that prevents the natural flow of blood within the vessel through this process (Ashorobi et al., 2022; Vyas &amp; Goyal, 2022).

    <para id="para-00016">While eating becomes a complex and breathless chore for clients with COPD, the nurse should educate clients on the proper nutritional intake to promote optimal pulmonary health and prevent COPD exacerbations. Clients who comprehend the need for appropriate healthy balance are met with improvements in health. A diet with high anti-inflammatory foods, such as fresh fruit and vegetables, with minimal consumption of processed sugar, salt, and fried fatty foods, is a solid recommendation from leading government entities. Macronutrient portion intake includes 15–20% proteins, 30–35% fats, and 40–45% carbohydrates (Collins et al., 2019; Hancu, 2019; Scoditti et al., 2019).

    <title>Asthma</title>
    <para id="para-00020">While some food triggers <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00036">asthma</term> and allergic symptoms, several foods and food groups have been shown to reduce the risk for developing asthma (Alwarith et al., 2020). Recommendations include daily ingestion of one or more servings of fruits and vegetables and whole grains, which may reduce the risk in children, adolescents, and adults. These food groups have also been shown to make asthma symptoms more manageable and are <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00037">inversely related</term> to wheezing in children because of the antioxidant effects and preventative oxidative damage. Fruit intake decreases asthma symptoms and the sensitization by inhaled allergens. The anti-inflammatory results of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00038">flavonoids</term> in raw vegetables (lost during the cooking process) are believed to explain the association between raw vegetable consumption and well-managed asthma (Alwarith et al., 2020). High-fat intake, commonly in Western dietary preferences, is associated with worsening airway inflammation and lung function limitations. Clients with asthma should consider a plant-based diet, vegetarian diet, or strictly vegan foods to reduce asthma risk and decreases the need for as-needed asthma medication use. If the client decides on a plant-based diet, counseling by a registered dietitian should be included to avoid nutritional deficiencies.</para>
    <para id="para-00021">According to Alwarith et al. (2020), a positive relationship exists between <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00039">dairy</term> consumption and concurrent asthma symptomology. Current dietary guidelines recommend three servings per day of dairy for clients with asthma, because it supplies calcium and vitamin D. Consultation with an allergist is recommended if dairy intake must be avoided (Comerford et al., 2021). The nurse should teach the clients who wish to avoid dairy products to seek plant-based milks that are fortified with vitamin D.

    <title>Pulmonary Fibrosis</title>
    <para id="para-00022">The adoption and continued consumption of unhealthy dietary selections increase and accelerate the risk for chronic diseases. Diets high in saturated fats increase the risk for pulmonary fibrosis development in both idiopathic and age-related cases (Mercader-Barcelo et al., 2020). In the same analysis, Mercader-Barcelo et al. (2020) state that a diet high in unsaturated fats reduces the severity of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00046">pulmonary fibrosis</term> and the development of pulmonary fibrosis. A diet high in saturated fats and high fructose corn syrup (sodas, candy, processed foods) sped up the development of pulmonary fibrosis, while a diet including plant-derived polysaccharides has shown antifibrotic effects. Plant-based polysaccharides include coconut fiber, barley, oats, wheat bran, and chicory root. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00047">amino acids</term> arginine, glycine, and L-norvaline have demonstrated protection against pulmonary fibrosis in animal studies as they reduce the buildup of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00048">neutrophils</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00049">macrophages</term> in peripheral blood. As with the chronic illnesses COPD and asthma, including foods high in vitamins A, B, C, D, and E is recommended.</para>

    <title>Respiratory Tract Infections and Pneumonia</title>
    <para id="para-00023">A healthy, balanced food intake boosts the immune system and helps <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00050">prevent respiratory tract infections</term>. Meeting optimal pulmonary health nutritional requirements moderates the body’s immune response, promoting lung health and respiratory homeostasis (Gozzi-Silva et al., 2021; Scoditti et al., 2019). Nutritional requirements for respiratory tract infections (RTI) and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00051">pneumonia</term> are similar. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00052">Undernutrition</term> is associated with an increased risk for frailty, difficulty in healing, increased risk for infection and worsening condition, morbidity, and mortality. A decrease in nutritional status predicts <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00053">life expectancy</term> in clients who begin with an RTI and develop pneumonia; becoming winded from eating leads to further deterioration of the condition. Nurses should seek to promote healthy habits to prevent and treat RTI with attention to vaccinations, adequate hydration, hand hygiene, smoking cessation, exercise, and nutrition.</para>
    <para id="para-00024">Vahid and Rahmani (2021) recommend an <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00054">anti-inflammatory diet</term> to prevent and manage RTI and pneumonia associated with infections and COPD. Their definition of an anti-inflammatory diet includes using turmeric, ginger, garlic, onion, saffron, vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc, and omega-3 fatty acids. They conclude that these supplements, bulbs, and spices decrease symptoms, minimize the duration, and prevent future infections. Consumption of the micronutrients vitamin C, vitamin D, and zinc play a role in strengthening and protecting the immune system. Adequate protein intake also supports the immune system per Vahid and Rahmani (2021). They state that the anti-inflammatory diet not only aids the immune system but also boosts lung function and decreases oxidation.</para>
    <para id="para-00025">Turmeric is a spice hailed for its anti-inflammatory properties. Turmeric contains <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00055">curcumin</term> (Vahid &amp; Rahmani, 2021), which inhibits the expression of cytokines, thus decreasing the inflammatory response. This inhibitor has also been proposed as an antiviral intermediary for RTI (Vahid &amp; Rahmani, 2021).</para>
    <para id="para-00026">Ginger is another spice belonging to the curcumin category, demonstrating similar antiviral and anti-inflammatory responses, such as its classmate turmeric. Ginger is thought to act by diminishing lung inflammation. See <link target-id="fig-00004" document="m00064"/></para>

    <para id="para-00027">Garlic has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cholesterol-lowering effects. Garlic is high in folic acid, vitamin C, calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium, zinc, vitamin B2, vitamin B1, and vitamin B3. Garlic is thought to have antiviral, antibiotic, and antifungal effects on the body. See <link target-id="table-00004" document="m00064"/>.</para>
