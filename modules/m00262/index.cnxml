<para id="para-00002"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">Multiple sclerosis</term> (MS) is a debilitating, inflammatory, immune-mediated condition. According to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (2023), studies have confirmed that nearly 1 million people are living with MS in the United States. This disease is characterized by a progressive and irreversible <term id="term-00002">demyelination</term> and axonal degeneration of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. Myelin is a protective sheath that acts as an insulator of the electrical signal (see <link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00262"/>). It allows rapid conduction of a nerve impulse down the axon. Degeneration of the <term id="term-00003">myelin sheath</term> results in the inability of nerves to conduct electrical impulses. As the myelin deteriorates, <term id="term-00004">oligodendrocytes</term> repair the damage, but also form scar tissue called gliotic plaques. These plaques will begin to interfere with electrical impulses traveling through the axon. Over time, the myelin cannot regenerate and nerves eventually wither away. Typically, the client experiences <term id="term-00005">remissions</term> and <term id="term-00006">exacerbations</term> throughout the progression. Sensory and motor deficits become worse as the client ages. The disease is progressive and affects nerves in both the CNS and peripheral nervous system (PNS) (Capriotti, 2020).</para>

<title>Etiology</title>
<para id="para-00005">MS is an <term id="term-00012">autoimmune</term> disorder that occurs when there is a malfunction of the immune system and the body mistakenly attacks its own tissue. In this case, it attacks the myelin sheath of the CNS. The exact cause of MS has not yet been fully determined; however, it is believed a combination of factors are involved. Risk factors include viral infections that theoretically mimic the components of the myelin sheath. The virus most associated with MS is the Epstein-Barr virus, which causes infectious mononucleosis. Other potential risk factors include geographic location, exposure to heavy metals, cigarette smoking (contributes to inflammation), lack of sunlight exposure, and deficient vitamin D levels. It is believed that vitamin D can lower the risk of developing autoimmune disorders because it plays a role in immune function and regulation. Moreover, obesity is a risk factor because it contributes to long-term inflammation. Likewise, family history is shown to contribute to a person’s risk of developing MS. Current research suggests there are numerous genetic variants, most of them correlating with the immune system. Some researchers believe the immune system attacks the CNS because it is simply destroying unhealthy brain cells (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, 2023a).</para>

<section id="sect-00004">
<title>Pathophysiology</title>
<para id="para-00006">Autoreactive lymphocytes mediate the destruction in MS. T-lymphocytes are sensitized and reactive to protein on the myelin sheath. These overactive immune cells cause inflammation, which begins to damage the myelin. The damage occurs in diffuse patches throughout the CNS. The damage mainly affects the white matter and results in lesions, which are called <term id="term-00013">plaques</term> because they are easily visible on imaging studies. Over time, hardened scar tissue develops at the lesion site, which disrupts the transmission of nerve signals. The scar tissue can slow or even stop nerve impulses altogether. Overall, signals are unable to communicate with the brain to receive information about what the body should do in situations. Other immune involvement includes <term id="term-00014">B lymphocytes</term>, <term id="term-00015">macrophages</term>, <term id="term-00016">immunoglobulins</term> (IgG and IgM), as well as T-helper and T-regulator cells. The immune cells are believed to release various cytokines, such as interleukins. The blood–brain barrier becomes disrupted and oligodendrocytes, along with axons, are destroyed. The oligodendrocytes that have not been affected are incapable of adequately <term id="term-00017">proliferating</term>; therefore, they are ineffective in repairing the myelin. As the disease progresses, the cerebral cortex of the brain atrophies and scar tissue begins to develop (Capriotti, 2020).</para>

<title>Diagnostics</title>
<para id="para-00008">Diagnosis is sometimes delayed because there is no definitive test for MS, and many early clinical manifestations are subtle and correlate with other diagnoses. The first steps toward a diagnosis are a thorough medical history and full neurological examination. An MRI test with contrast is the most sensitive method available to identify areas of demyelination. The response of the CNS to peripheral sensory stimuli can be determined using evoked potential testing—tests that measure electrical activity in response to certain stimuli—for various pathways (visual, auditory, and sensory). Another diagnostic tool is the evaluation of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained from a lumbar puncture. Clients with MS have high protein levels, oligoclonal bands (OCBs), IgG/IgM, and T and B lymphocytes in their CSF. Blood tests may be obtained to rule out other conditions that mimic MS or to check for risk factors, such as a vitamin D level (Capriotti, 2020).</para>

<section id="sect-00006">
<title>Clinical Manifestations</title>
<para id="para-00009">The course of MS is unpredictable. Signs and symptoms vary depending on severity and the specific nerves affected by the plaque. Some clients will have very little disability whereas others experience a steady decline with increasing disability. Fever, sun exposure, and stress can trigger exacerbations. Characteristic manifestations include the following:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00003">
<item>Sensory deficits in extremities and face (numbness and tingling sensation, itching, coldness, paralysis)
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00004">

<item>Pain (<term id="term-00024">neuropathic pain</term> in extremities, painful muscle spasms)</item>
</list>
<para id="para-00010">The most common form of MS is the relapsing-remitting form, which consists of brief episodes of several weeks to 3 months. These episodes are followed by a complete or almost complete return to baseline. The primary-progressive form does not have any remissions or exacerbations. The onset of this form is around age 40. Those with relapsing-remitting form may go on to develop secondary-progressive deterioration that leads to disabilities (Capriotti, 2020; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, 2023a).

<title>Pharmacologic Management</title>
<para id="para-00011">There is currently no cure for MS; however, the use of drugs has made a significant difference in the lives of those with MS. Most of the drugs target specific symptoms, reduce relapse rates, and delay progression. In the most common form (relapsing-remitting), early initiation of medications is highly recommended. Several drug classifications are used that work through different mechanisms: corticosteroids can reduce inflammation and speed recovery during acute exacerbations; beta interferons can slow damage; and disease-modifying agents and immunomodulators suppress the immune system to prevent the antibodies from attacking their own cells. Additionally, various components of the immune system are specifically targeted by medications. Some drugs reduce the number of T cells circulating in the periphery; others destroy target B cells or deplete B and T cells; still others prevent leukocyte mobilization to injured tissue. Drugs, such as antispasmodics, antidepressants, and antiepileptics, are prescribed to control symptoms.</para>
</section>
<section id="sect-00008">
<title>Nonpharmacologic Management</title>
<para id="para-00012">Plasmapheresis (removal of abnormal antibodies) can be done for those who do not respond well to drugs. Significant nonpharmacologic management should involve teaching the client coping mechanisms, ensuring support systems are in place, and emphasizing proper nutrition and sufficient rest; the client should be encouraged to incorporate exercise into their daily routine. These actions can promote overall health, which can help the client better deal with symptoms of relapse, as well as maintain their quality of life. Finally, physical therapy and occupational therapy can help to maximize functioning in various ways (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, 2023a).</para>
<note class="trending-today" id="note-00003">
<para id="para-00013">According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (2023a), researchers continue to study the mechanism of MS to identify ways to prevent or stop the continuous decline in function seen in clients with this progressive disease. <link url="https://openstax.org/r/tgtherapeutics"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00025">Ublituximab (Briumvi)</term></link> recently became the third anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody approved by the FDA as a treatment for relapsing forms of MS (Cunha, 2023). This drug is administered over 1 hour and given twice a year.</para>

<para id="para-00014"><emphasis effect="bold">Treating an Acute Relapse</emphasis></para>
<para id="para-00015">A short course of a high-dose intravenous (IV) glucocorticoid (e.g., 500–1000 mg of methylprednisolone daily for 3–5 days) is the preferred treatment for an acute episode. These drugs suppress inflammation and can reduce the severity and duration of an attack. When used short-term, these drugs are safe except for a possible elevation of blood glucose levels. In contrast, long-term use (e.g., over 3 weeks) can cause multiple adverse effects in numerous areas of the body, including adrenal insufficiency leading to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, osteoporosis, high risk for infections, myopathy, and psychological disturbances (agitation, anxiety, or irritability).</para>
<para id="para-00016">Acute relapse may also be treated with IV gamma globulin. This option is especially beneficial for clients who are unable to tolerant or respond adequately to glucocorticoids.</para>
