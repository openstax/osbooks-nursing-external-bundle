<para id="para-00002"><term id="term-00001">Homeostasis</term> is the ability of the body to maintain a stable and constant internal environment despite changes in the external environment (Billman, 2020). This means that the body can regulate and balance its various physiologic processes, such as body temperature (see <link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00232"/>), fluid balance, pH levels, blood sugar levels, and hormone levels, to ensure they remain within a narrow range that is optimal for the body’s functioning.</para>
<figure class="scaled-down" id="fig-00001"><media alt="A flow chart shows how normal body temperature is maintained. If the body temperature rises (the cycle depicted on the right of the chart), blood vessels dilate, resulting in loss of heat to the environment. Sweat glands secrete fluid. As this fluid evaporates, heat is lost form the body. As a result, the body temperature falls to normal body temperature. If body temperature falls (the cycle depicted on the left), blood vessels constrict so that heat is conserved. Sweat glands do not secrete fluid. Shivering (involuntary contraction of muscles) releases heat which warms the body. Heat is retained, and body temperature increases to normal.">

<title>Homeostasis</title>
<para id="para-00003">Homeostasis is a fundamental process that enables the body to maintain a stable internal environment in the face of constantly changing internal and external conditions. Disruption of homeostatic mechanisms may cause diseases and severe impacts on physiologic well-being. Two key principles govern homeostasis: fluid balance and electrolyte balance.</para>
<para id="para-00004">The first principle of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">fluid balance</term> involves maintaining the body’s fluid compartments in <emphasis effect="bold">osmotic equilibrium</emphasis>, except for <term id="term-00003">transient change</term>. This means that the concentration of <term id="term-00004">solutes</term> in each compartment is carefully regulated to prevent water from flowing into or out of cells, which could disrupt cellular function (Koeppen &amp; Stanton, 2023; Valls &amp; Esposito, 2022).</para>
<para id="para-00005">The second principle of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">electrolyte balance</term> involves ensuring that the numbers of <term id="term-00006">ions</term> (<term id="term-00007">anions</term> or <term id="term-00008">cations</term>) within each compartment of the body are balanced and electrically neutral. Each compartment works to maintain a constant volume of fluid and to replace and exchange ions to maintain this neutrality (Koeppen &amp; Stanton, 2023; Valls &amp; Esposito, 2022). This helps ensure that the body’s pH remains within a narrow range, which is essential for proper physiologic functioning.</para>

<title>Homeostasis in Children, Pregnant Clients, and Older Adults</title>
<para id="para-00006"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">Children</term> have unique physiologic characteristics and developmental needs. Children have a relatively higher water requirement compared with adults because of their higher metabolic rate and larger proportion of body water. Children are also more likely than older individuals to become dehydrated because their kidneys are less efficient at conserving water. Electrolyte balance in children may be more susceptible to imbalances because of their immature kidneys, resulting in higher renal losses of sodium and potassium.</para>
<para id="para-00007"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">Pregnancy</term> brings about significant physiologic changes that impact homeostatic mechanisms. Pregnancy increases blood volume and fluid retention to support the developing fetus. Hormonal changes influence fluid balance, causing the client to be more susceptible to edema and electrolyte imbalances. Increased levels of progesterone can also affect electrolyte regulation. Changes in kidney function and the demands of the developing fetus may impact the delicate balance of sodium, potassium, and calcium.</para>
<para id="para-00008">As individuals age, various physiologic changes occur. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011"> Older adults</term> often have a reduced sense of thirst and may not drink enough fluids, leading to an increased risk for dehydration. Age-related changes in the kidneys can also affect water and electrolyte regulation, resulting in a higher risk for imbalances such as hyponatremia (low sodium) and hyperkalemia (elevated potassium).</para>
</note>
<para id="para-00009">Homeostasis is a complex mechanism that requires an integrated control system for self-regulation. It is primarily governed by a <term id="term-00012">feedback loop</term> that involves three key components: the receptor, the control center, and the effector (<link target-id="fig-00002" document="m00232"/>).</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00002">
<item>The <term id="term-00013">receptor</term> is a sensory organ that detects changes in the internal or external environment of the body. It sends signals to the control center when it detects a change that needs to be corrected.</item>
<item>The control center is typically located in the brain or other part of the nervous system. It receives the signals from the receptor and processes them to determine the appropriate response. The control center then signals the effector.</item>
<item>The <term id="term-00014">effector</term> is the part of the body that carries out the response. It could be a muscle, gland, or organ that alters its activity to counteract the initial change detected by the receptor.</item>

<para id="para-00010">The feedback loop plays a critical role in maintaining a balanced internal environment in the face of changing internal and external conditions (Hannezo &amp; Heisenberg, 2019; Molnar &amp; Gair, n.d.). By detecting and correcting deviations from the set point, the body is able to ensure that its various physiologic processes are functioning optimally, thereby promoting overall health and well-being.</para>

<title>Cellular Compartments</title>
<para id="para-00011">Sixty percent of the total body weight is composed of water. The body separates this water into two main fluid compartments: one that contains <term id="term-00015">intracellular fluid</term> and one that contains <term id="term-00016">extracellular fluid</term>. The fluid compartments work together to maintain fluid and electrolyte balance within the body. The movement of water and electrolytes between the compartments is regulated by various mechanisms, such as <term id="term-00017">osmosis</term> and <term id="term-00018">active transport</term> (Libretti &amp; Puckett, 2023; Molnar &amp; Gair, n.d).</para>
<para id="para-00012">The body strives to maintain a balance between the fluids in the compartment to ensure that the cells are surrounded by an environment that allows them to function optimally, as can be observed in <link target-id="fig-00003" document="m00232"/>. The concentration of ions, such as sodium, potassium, and chloride, is carefully regulated in each compartment to maintain the proper <term id="term-00019">osmotic pressure</term>, which is the pressure needed to prevent water from flowing into or out of cells.</para>
<para id="para-00013">Disruptions in the fluid compartments, such as excessive fluid loss or retention, can lead to various health problems, including dehydration or edema. By regulating the equilibrium of body fluids, the body can guarantee the optimal operation of its diverse physiologic functions, thereby enhancing overall health and well-being.</para>

<title>Intracellular Fluid</title>
<para id="para-00014">Intracellular fluid, also known as <term id="term-00020">cytoplasm</term>, refers to the fluid contained within the cells of the body. As shown in <link target-id="table-00001" document="m00232"/>, intracellular fluid accounts for approximately 40% of the total body fluid in adults, and it plays a critical role in many physiologic processes.</para>
<para id="para-00015">The composition of intracellular fluid is tightly regulated to ensure that it provides an optimal environment for cellular function. It contains various electrolytes, such as potassium, magnesium, and phosphate ions, as well as proteins and other molecules essential for cell function.</para>

<section id="sect-00005">
<title>Extracellular Fluid</title>
<para id="para-00016">Extracellular fluid is the fluid that surrounds the cells of the body, including fluid in the blood vessels and the fluid in the spaces between tissues and organs. It accounts for approximately 20% of the total body fluid in adults.</para>
<para id="para-00017">Extracellular fluid contains various electrolytes, such as sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate, as well as proteins, hormones, and other molecules.</para>
<para id="para-00018">The extracellular fluid is divided into three subcompartments. The <term id="term-00021">interstitial compartment</term>, which surrounds the tissue cells, makes up approximately 15% of fluid volume; the <term id="term-00022">intravascular compartment</term>, which contains the plasma and blood, makes up approximately 5% of fluid volume; and the <term id="term-00023">transcellular compartment</term> makes up approximately 1% of fluid but is generally not included in fluid volume calculations.</para>

<section id="sect-00006">
<title>Transcellular Compartment (Third Space)</title>
<para id="para-00019">The transcellular compartment, also known as the third space, refers to a small volume of fluid that is contained within certain body cavities and structures, such as the pleural cavity, peritoneal cavity, and joint spaces. This compartment is separate from the intracellular and extracellular fluid compartments and is characterized by its limited communication with the rest of the body. The volume of fluid in the transcellular compartment is regulated by various mechanisms, including pressure and transport mechanisms, which ensure that it is in balance with the other fluid compartments. <link target-id="table-00001" document="m00232"/> lists fluid compartments and their volumes and major electrolytes for an adult.</para>
