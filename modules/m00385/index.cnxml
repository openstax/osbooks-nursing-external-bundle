    <title>Bile Acid Sequestrants</title>
    <para id="para-00003"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">Bile acid sequestrants</term> are a class of drugs that lower cholesterol. Bile acids are made from cholesterol and are released from the small intestine to aid in fat digestion after the individual consumes food. The majority of bile acids are reabsorbed back into the body after use. Bile acid sequestrants work by binding to bile acids in the intestine, which reduces their absorption and decreases the amount of bile acids available in the body. The body compensates for this by producing more bile acids from cholesterol, effectively decreasing the amount of cholesterol that remains.</para>
    <para id="para-00004">Bile acid sequestrants are often used as second-line therapy for hypercholesterolemia if clients do not achieve sufficient goals using first-line therapy or if they are intolerant to first-line therapy. Bile acid sequestrants can be expected to lower the LDL-cholesterol levels by 15%–30% (Grundy et al., 2019). Response to therapy is monitored by obtaining LDL-cholesterol levels. These drugs are orally administered and are not absorbed into the systemic circulation; therefore, they are best taken with meals so that they will encounter the bile acids upon secretion. However, their use is limited by frequency of dosing, an unfavorable gastrointestinal adverse effect profile, and their propensity for interaction with other drugs, which necessitates coordination of administration. Also, outcomes data in cardiovascular disease are lacking when used in combination with statins, the first-line therapy for hypercholesterolemia and cardiovascular risk reduction.</para>
    <para id="para-00005">Three bile acid sequestrants are used for treating hyperlipidemia. The drugs have few distinguishing factors beyond the class effects listed here. Some of the differentiators are the available dosage forms (tablets, powder), administration instructions, and FDA-approved indications. These are summarized in <link target-id="table-00002" document="m00385"/>; however, it is always best to check the specific product labeling for administration instructions.</para>

    <title>Fibrates</title>
    <para id="para-00006"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">Fibrates</term> are a group of oral drugs that are used primarily to treat hypertriglyceridemia. They include fenofibric acid, fenofibrate, and gemfibrozil. They work by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. The primary result of this activation is lower triglyceride levels via increased expression of lipoprotein lipase, an enzyme that breaks down triglycerides. Fibrates also lead to increased HDL-cholesterol and mildly lower LDL-cholesterol levels; however, they are not typically recommended for those uses (Grundy et al., 2019). Adverse effects of fibrates include increased serum transaminase, creatine phosphokinase (CPK), and creatinine levels; myopathy; cholelithiasis; and venous thrombosis.</para>

    <title>Fenofibric Acid Derivatives</title>
    <para id="para-00007"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">Fenofibric acid</term> is an active drug that directly stimulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors as described above. It is available in the active form under the brand name Fibricor and as generic drugs. An inactive form called fenofibrate is also available; this form converts to fenofibric acid in the body after ingestion. Some of the available dosage forms of fenofibrate are Antara, Lipofen, Fenoglide, Tricor, Trilipix (choline fenofibrate), and their respective generic formulations. The various fenofibrate dosage forms are not bioequivalent and cannot be substituted for each other or for fenofibric acid on a milligram-per-milligram basis; they use different types of medication delivery technology to ensure absorption, including micronized particles, nanocrystals, and different salt forms.</para>

    <title>Gemfibrozil</title>
    <para id="para-00009"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020">Gemfibrozil</term> is another fibrate approved for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia and for primary prevention of CAD in clients who have failed to respond to lifestyle changes and other pharmacologic therapies. Gemfibrozil is generally administered orally, twice daily, 30 minutes before breakfast and dinner. The most common adverse events are dyspepsia, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Less commonly, abnormal liver function tests and worsening renal function in those with baseline dysfunction have been reported. It is contraindicated in clients with severe hepatic or renal disease, preexisting gallbladder disease, or hypersensitivity to gemfibrozil.</para>
    <para id="para-00010">Gemfibrozil is associated with several notable drug interactions. The concomitant use of gemfibrozil and rosuvastatin or simvastatin is contraindicated because of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. If the client needs to take both a fibrate and a statin, it is safer to use a fenofibric acid derivative. Similarly, a client taking gemfibrozil with colchicine should be monitored for the same concerns of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Concomitant use with warfarin places the client at risk for bleeding, so frequent monitoring of the international normalized ratio is recommended until stabilization.</para>

    <title>Niacin</title>
    <para id="para-00012"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">Niacin (vitamin B<sub>3</sub>)</term> is a water-soluble vitamin. The chemical name for niacin is nicotinic acid. It is approved for treatment of hyperlipidemia, dyslipidemia, and hypertriglyceridemia; for secondary prevention of myocardial infarction; and, in combination with a bile acid sequestrant, for slowing the progression or promoting the regression of atherosclerotic disease. The specific mechanism of action of niacin in dyslipidemia is not well understood. It may increase the activity of lipoprotein lipase, the main enzyme that is affected by fibrates, or it may increase the rate of removal from plasma and decrease the rate of synthesis of LDL-cholesterol. The therapeutic effect in dyslipidemia is a reduction in triglyceride, LDL-cholesterol, and total cholesterol levels as well as an increase in HDL-cholesterol levels.</para>
    <para id="para-00013">Niacin is available in various dosage forms. Many are considered dietary supplements and thus are not regulated by the FDA. Some of these dietary supplements are marketed as “flush-free” niacin; however, these flush-free versions have been shown to contain no free nicotinic acid and should not be used to treat dyslipidemia (National Institutes of Health, 2022). Prescription niacin products include extended-release and immediate-release formulations. Nurses should be aware that the various niacin preparations are not interchangeable on a milligram-per-milligram basis.</para>

    <title>Adverse Effects and Contraindications</title>
    <para id="para-00014"><emphasis effect="bold">Bile acid sequestrants.</emphasis> Because these drugs are not absorbed into the systemic circulation, systemic adverse effects are limited; side effects from bile acid sequestrants are generally related to their effect on the gastrointestinal system. Constipation is the most common one; it can be severe and can aggravate hemorrhoids. Clients can minimize constipation by starting doses cautiously, taking one per day. It can also be managed with increased fluids and dietary fiber and, if needed, a stool softener. Other gastrointestinal adverse effects include abdominal pain, heartburn, loss of appetite, indigestion, diarrhea, and upset stomach.</para>
    <para id="para-00015">Bile acid sequestrants also can cause an increase in triglyceride levels, which is typically mild. However, in clients with a triglyceride level of 300 mg/dL or higher at baseline, hypertriglyceridemia can be severe. With long-term therapy of high doses, absorption of some fat-soluble nutrients may be decreased, and supplementation of vitamins A, D, E, and K may be needed. In extreme cases, bleeding can occur due to an induced deficiency of vitamin K, which is needed for the synthesis of clotting factors. Additionally, bile acid sequestrants can interfere with the absorption of some drugs. Because of this, it is recommended that clients take other drugs at least 1 hour before or 3–4 hours after taking a bile acid sequestrant (Grundy et al., 2019).</para>
    <para id="para-00016">Because of the high incidence of constipation, bile acid sequestrants are contraindicated in clients with a history of bowel obstruction. Because these drugs can increase triglycerides, they also are contraindicated in clients who have baseline hypertriglyceridemia or a history of pancreatitis due to hypertriglyceridemia.</para>
    <para id="para-00017"><emphasis effect="bold">Fibrates.</emphasis> The most common adverse effects of fibrates are elevated liver enzymes, increases in serum creatinine, and myopathy, especially when fibrates are combined with statin medications. They should not be used in clients who have active liver disease, gallbladder disease, severe renal dysfunction, or hypersensitivity (Singh &amp; Correa, 2023).</para>
    <para id="para-00018"><emphasis effect="bold">Niacin.</emphasis> The most limiting adverse effect of niacin is flushing, which is most prominent in the immediate-release preparations. This occurs because niacin increases prostaglandins in capillaries, leading to cutaneous vasodilation. It can be managed by slowing down the niacin absorption rate by using a slower-release (extended-release) version or by administering a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as aspirin 30 minutes before niacin administration (National Institutes of Health, 2022). Clients taking niacin can minimize flushing by avoiding hot drinks and alcoholic beverages. Significant adverse effects include hepatotoxicity, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and hyperuricemia (National Institutes of Health, 2022).</para>
    <para id="para-00019">Niacin is contraindicated in clients with active liver disease, unexplained or persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase levels, active peptic ulcer disease, arterial bleeding, or hypersensitivity to niacin or components of the formulation.</para>
