<title>Growth Hormone</title>
<para id="para-00002">Growth hormones and suppressants are used to treat various growth and development disorders. Growth hormone, also known as somatotropin or human growth hormone, is essential for the body’s growth and development. Growth hormone stimulates the production of the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in the liver, which promotes the growth of bone, muscle, and other tissues. Growth hormone also helps to regulate metabolism and breakdown fats. Growth hormone is particularly important during childhood and adolescence when it promotes the growth and development of the body. However, growth hormone continues to be important throughout adulthood, helping to maintain healthy bone density, muscle mass, and overall wellbeing.</para>
<para id="para-00003">Deficiencies in growth hormone can lead to stunted growth, delayed puberty, and other health issues. Conversely, excessive growth hormone production can result in abnormal growth of bones and soft tissues, causing gigantism in children or <term id="term-00001">acromegaly</term> in adults.</para>
<section id="sect-00003">
<title>Somatropin</title>
<para id="para-00004">Somatropin (different from somatotropin mentioned above) is a recombinant growth hormone that is used to treat failure to grow due to growth hormone deficiency in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">pediatric</term> and adult clients; some forms of this prescription are indicated in the treatment of <term id="term-00003">Prader-Willi syndrome</term>. The drug is available in a subcutaneous injection dosage form and is individualized based on the client needs.</para>
<para id="para-00005">Drug interactions include glucocorticoids, which may oppose the growth-promoting effects of somatropin; oral estrogen, which impacts growth hormone secretion; and insulin or oral diabetes drugs, which may need dosages altered due to somatropin increasing glucose levels in the blood. The most common adverse effects are injection site reaction, rash, lipoatrophy, thyroid hormone suppression, and headaches. Somatropin is contraindicated in clients who are critically ill or have active malignancy, impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes, hypersensitivity, or closed epiphyses.</para>

<section id="sect-00004">
<title>Growth Hormone Suppressants</title>
<para id="para-00006">Growth hormone suppressants are medications used to reduce the production or activity of growth hormone in the body. These drugs are typically used to treat medical conditions such as acromegaly or gigantism. Suppressants include <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">somatostatin analogs</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">dopamine agonists</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">growth hormone receptor antagonists</term>. Nurses should note that these drugs should only be used under the guidance of a qualified health care provider because they can have significant side effects on the body and may interact with other medications or medical conditions.</para>
<section id="sect-00005">
<title>Bromocriptine Mesylate</title>
<para id="para-00007">Bromocriptine mesylate is a dopamine receptor agonist. This grown hormone suppressant stimulates the dopamine receptors in the brain and helps to reduce prolactin production as well as lessen symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. It also is used to treat clients with acromegaly or those with high levels of prolactin, which can cause a lack of menstrual periods and infertility. Bromocriptine mesylate is readily absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract and mainly excreted in the urine. Adverse effects include nausea, headache, dizziness, fatigue, vomiting, abdominal cramps, nasal congestion, constipation, and drowsiness. This drug is contraindicated in clients with uncontrolled hypertension, hypersensitivity, and pregnancy.</para>
</section>
<section id="sect-00006">
<title>Lanreotide Acetate</title>
<para id="para-00008">The growth hormone suppressant, lanreotide acetate, is a somatostatin analog and is used to treat acromegaly in clients who have had an inadequate response to or cannot be treated with surgery and/or radiotherapy and to treat clients with certain types of unresectable tumors. Drug interactions include cyclosporine, bromocriptine, and beta blockers. Adverse reactions include diarrhea, cholelithiasis, abdominal pain, nausea, and injection site reactions. Lanreotide acetate is contraindicated in clients with previous hypersensitivity reaction to lanreotide or any of the ingredients in the formulation.</para>
</section>
<section id="sect-00007">
<title>Octreotide Acetate</title>
<para id="para-00009">Octreotide acetate inhibits growth hormone as a suppressant and is used in the treatment of acromegaly and certain types of tumors. See <link target-id="table-00002" document="m00405"/> for additional information on octreotide acetate.</para>
</section>
<section id="sect-00008">
<title>Pegvisomant</title>
<para id="para-00010">The growth hormone receptor antagonist, pegvisomant, is indicated for the treatment of acromegaly in clients who have inadequate response to surgery or radiation therapy or for whom these therapies are inappropriate. Adverse reactions include infection, pain, nausea, diarrhea, abnormal liver tests, flu-like symptoms, and injection site reactions. Pegvisomant is contraindicated in clients with diabetes or hypoglycemia, liver toxicity, or hypersensitivity.</para>

<title>Adverse Effects and Contraindications</title>
<para id="para-00012">Common adverse effects of growth hormone suppressants include gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting; low or high blood glucose levels; vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency; fatigue and weakness; and injection site reactions such as redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site.</para>
<para id="para-00013">Contraindications include hypersensitivity to the drugs or any of their components, uncontrolled diabetes—as growth hormone suppressants can have potential effects on blood glucose regulation—severe liver disease and severe kidney disease. These drugs are metabolized by the liver and can cause further hepatic impairment in clients with liver disease, and because they are excreted in the urine, they can cause further renal insufficiency in clients with kidney disease.</para>
