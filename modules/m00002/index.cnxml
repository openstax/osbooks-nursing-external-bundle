<title>A Basic Definition of Nutrition</title>
<para id="para-00002"><term id="term-00001">Nutrition</term> is the intake of food to meet the needs of the body. Accordingly, <term id="term-00002">nutrients</term> are substances found in foods and beverages that are essential for survival. Nurses must understand the components of nutrition and its impact on bodily functions to provide effective nursing care.</para>
<para id="para-00003">Several food-related concepts are fundamental to understanding how nutrition affects the body. The term <term id="term-00003">food</term> refers to edible substances made of protein, carbohydrates, fat, or other nutrients. Food is comprised of macronutrients and/or micronutrients. <term id="term-00004">Macronutrients</term> are water and energy-yielding nutrients (carbohydrates, fats, and proteins) needed in large amounts by the body. <term id="term-00005">Micronutrients</term> include vitamins and minerals. Food is the building block of the <term id="term-00006">diet</term> which describes the quantity and quality of food and drinks consumed.</para>

<title>Nutrition in Foods</title>
<para id="para-00004">Understanding <term id="term-00007">calories</term> is essential to understanding how the body uses nutrients for fuel. Calories, which measure the amount of heat it takes to raise 1 kg of water by 1ºC, are used to indicate the amount of energy needed or ingested daily. Human bodies need calories to function, digest food, grow, and move. The <emphasis effect="italics">2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines</emphasis> issued jointly by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommend adult women consume an estimated 1,600 to 2,400 calories daily and adult men 2,000 to 3,000 calories daily based on age and activity level (USDA &amp; USHHS, 2020).</para>
<para id="para-00005">The number of calories found in food varies based on food type. <link target-id="table-00001" document="m00002"/> lists the number of calories found in macronutrients. Food preparation can modify the number of calories present. For example, a raw tomato has fewer calories than a fried tomato. Water is classified as a macronutrient. Although it serves a vital role, it does not provide energy to the body.</para>

<title>The History of Nutrition in the Provision of Client Care</title>
<para id="para-00007">Modern nutrition science advanced significantly during the 20th century (Mozaffarian, Rosenberg &amp; Uauy, 2018). The identification of essential vitamins and minerals in the early 1900s launched the quest to identify and treat vitamin-deficient medical conditions such as beriberi. Subsequent nutritional discoveries led to the practice of fortifying certain foods to prevent deficiencies and setting the first recommended dietary allowances (RDAs).</para>
<para id="para-00008">During this same timeframe, the federal government began to oversee and manage the food supply. In 1906, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">Pure Food and Drugs Act</term> was passed, which launched the federal regulation of foods by the agency later known as the U.S. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">Food and Drug Administration (FDA)</term> (2018). The FDA was initially established to oversee how food was prepared for consumers. This became necessary as more people moved from rural to urban areas, they depended on others to grow and produce the food they needed.</para>
<para id="para-00009">In 1938, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act</term> (FDCA) of 1938 was passed, significantly enhancing labeling requirements. The FDCA required food labels to include the product’s recognizable name and standardized information related to the identity, quality, and amount in the container (Lam &amp; Patel, 2022).</para>
<para id="para-00010">Later, in the second half of the 20th century, the focus of nutrition shifted toward nutrition and its relationship to health (USDA &amp; USHHS, n.d.). In 1977, the first-ever federal guidance related to diet quality was published in <emphasis effect="italics">Dietary Goals for the United States</emphasis>. These goals were intended to improve the typical American diet to decrease the incidence of heart disease. The development of these goals prompted pushback from some members of the food industry. For example, the goals originally recommended to reduce the intake of red meat in the diet. However, groups such as the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, opposed this recommendation since it would negatively affect the beef industry. Consequently, the language in the federal guidelines was changed from minimizing red meat to selecting foods that will minimize saturated fat intake (Stillerman, 2019).</para>
<para id="para-00011">Continuing this new shift in perspective in 1982, the Committee on Diet, Nutrition, and Cancer, National Research Council presented their findings on the relationship between diet and cancer. These findings served as a foundation to promote nutritional factors and dietary needs that decrease the incidence of cancer. Not only did the report discuss foods linked to the potential development of cancer, but it also identified foods that supported <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">cancer prevention</term>. This study specifically mentioned macronutrients and micronutrients found in the diet and their impact on cancer development and/or prevention. This introduction of macronutrients and micronutrients to the public facilitated several agencies to take active roles in promoting dietary agendas. For example, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">Nutrition Labeling and Education Act</term> of 1990 prompted all <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">food packaging</term> entities to label foods with nutritional information and serving sizes.</para>
<para id="para-00012">Through the years, visual displays of government food guides have been modified to reflect the changing perspectives. The first guide, released in the 1940s, divided foods into seven groups and encouraged people to eat foods from all groups as well as food not included in the seven groups without specifying amounts. The widely recognized Food Guide Pyramid was first introduced in the 1990s and underwent several revisions until it was replaced by MyPlate in 2011 (Davis &amp; Saltos, n.d.; USDA, 2021). The most recent dietary guidelines for Americans, 2020–2025, uses the original MyPlate visual guide to recommend small, simple changes to improve diet quality.</para>

<title>Nutrition for Wellness</title>
<para id="para-00013">The Global Wellness Institute defines <term id="term-00018">wellness</term> as pursuing activities, choices, and lifestyles leading to holistic health. Multiple factors influence a person’s health, including nutrition. Good nutrition is essential for keeping the population healthy (CDC, 2021).</para>
<section id="sect-00006">
<title>Origin of Nutrition Related to Wellness</title>
<para id="para-00014">The ancient Greek physician who influenced much of modern medicine, Hippocrates, is credited with saying, “Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food” (King, 2019). This appears to be one of the earliest statements acknowledging the role of nutrition in maintaining health. In 1948, the World Health Organization (WHO) defined <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">health</term> as “a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity” (WHO, n.d.). This definition reflected a growing emphasis on a holistic perspective of health.</para>

<section id="sect-00007">
<title>Weight Versus Body Mass Index</title>
<para id="para-00015">Several measurements are recognized and used to assess a person’s nutritional status and identify individuals at risk for illness or disease. These indicators go beyond simply measuring a person’s weight to assess body composition and weight distribution. <term id="term-00020">Body mass index (BMI)</term> is a formula that calculates the ratio of weight and height to classify individuals as underweight, healthy weight, overweight, or obese. The <term id="term-00021">waist-to-hip ratio (WHR)</term> calculates the ratio of the circumferences of the waist to the hip. Evidence has shown that individuals with excess weight around their midsection may be at higher risk for certain health conditions. These simple assessments can be done at home or with a healthcare provider to gain important information on the status of an individual’s dietary-related health.</para>
<note class="special-considerations" id="note-00002">
<title>BMI and Diverse Populations</title>
<para id="para-00016">Recently, the routine use of BMI as a lone indicator of obesity has been scrutinized as a result of research that shows BMI may not be a reliable indicator for diverse populations. The American Medical Association (AMA) has adopted a new policy clarifying the use of BMI as one means of identifying obesity. The policy states that BMI should not be used exclusively to identify obesity; instead, it should be used in conjunction with other assessment tools. The policy acknowledges the BMI assessment is based on data from non-Hispanic White populations and does not consider differences in body shape and composition across different race/ethnic groups, sexes, or age groups (AMA, 2023).</para>

<title>Calculating BMI</title>
<para id="para-00017"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">BMI</term> is a screening tool used to identify clients who are overweight or obese. Considering the recent policy change by the AMA, nurses should stay abreast of new research to determine how to incorporate BMI measurements when working with diverse client populations. BMI does not measure body fat directly but correlates with other more direct measures of body fat such as skinfold thickness measurements. High BMI can be correlated with obesity-linked adverse health outcomes. To determine BMI, input the client’s height and weight <link url="https://openstax.org/r/cdchealthyweight">into the Adult BMI Calculator</link>.
