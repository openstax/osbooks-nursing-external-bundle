      <title>Hypertension</title>
    <para id="para-00001">As the cardiovascular system transports blood and oxygen to needed organs and systems within the body (see <link target-id="pharma_fig_18_01_001" document="m00020"/>). The blood flow moves from a system of higher resistance to one of lower resistance—from arteries to capillaries to veins. Blood pressure (see <link target-id="table_18_01_001"/>) represents the force that blood flow exerts on arterial walls.</para>
    <para id="para-00003">
      The two elements that determine blood pressure are cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance. <term id="term-00001">Cardiac output</term> is the product of the <term id="term-00002">heart rate</term>, the number of times the heart beats per minute, and <term id="term-00003">stroke volume</term>, or the amount of blood ejected with each heartbeat (<m:math><m:mrow><m:mi>C</m:mi><m:mi>O</m:mi><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:mi>H</m:mi><m:mi>R</m:mi><m:mo>×</m:mo><m:mi>S</m:mi><m:mi>V</m:mi></m:mrow></m:math>). This represents the <term id="term-00004">systolic blood pressure</term> reading, the higher pressure (resistance) within the arteries and vessels. <term id="term-00005">Peripheral vascular resistance</term> (also known as systemic vascular resistance) is determined by blood flow and the level of constriction or dilatation within the arteries and vessels. This indicates the <term id="term-00006">diastolic blood pressure (DBP)</term> reading, which is the lower pressure within the arteries and vessels. Blood pressure (BP) is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and is expressed as the systolic pressure over the diastolic pressure (for instance, 125/90 mm Hg). <term id="term-00007">Hypertension</term> is when an individual’s blood pressure is above normal limits for a sustained period of time.
    </para>
    <para id="para-00004">
      Hypertension can be either primary (essential) hypertension or <term id="term-00008" class="no-emphasis">secondary hypertension</term>. Primary hypertension is caused by unknown elements; however, genetics and behavioral and environmental factors have been indicated. These factors include age, high salt intake, insulin resistance, obesity, high alcohol intake, sedentary lifestyle, smoking, and stress. According to the American Heart Association (2022), <term id="term-00009" class="no-emphasis">primary hypertension</term> makes up approximately 90–95% of hypertension cases.
    </para>
    <para id="para-00005">
      Secondary hypertension results from another disease processes such as conditions involving the central nervous system, endocrine system, and renal system. Secondary hypertension is treated along with the underlying condition. Secondary hypertension may be cured if the treatment for the underlying condition is successful.
    </para>
    <para id="para-00006">
      Hormones also impact blood pressure regulation. The <term id="term-00010">renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)</term> and vasopressin are the main hormones affecting blood pressure homeostasis. RAAS is a compensatory mechanism the body activates during <term id="term-00011">hypotension</term> (when the blood pressure is low). Renin is released from the kidneys in response to low blood pressure. Renin interacts with angiotensinogen and converts it to <term id="term-00012">angiotensin I</term>. The angiotensin-converting enzyme in the pulmonary blood vessel endothelium is then triggered to produce <term id="term-00013">angiotensin II</term>, which constricts arterioles, increasing peripheral resistance and therefore increasing blood pressure. Angiotensin II also stimulates the adrenal medulla to produce catecholamine, which yields <term id="term-00014">aldosterone</term>. Aldosterone causes the kidneys to retain water and sodium, which results in increased blood volume, cardiac output, and blood pressure.
    </para>
    <para id="para-00007">
      <term id="term-00015">Vasopressin</term>, which is an antidiuretic hormone that regulates reabsorption of water by the kidneys. It is released by the pituitary gland in response to low blood volume. Vasopressin causes retention of body fluids, vasoconstriction, and increased blood pressure.

      <title>Grades of Hypertension</title>
      <para id="para-00010">
        The American Heart Association (AHA) (2022) states that normal blood pressure is the level at which minimal vascular damage occurs and blood flow is sufficient to support oxygenation.
      </para>
      <para id="para-00011">
        Normal blood pressure is considered a systolic reading of less than 120 mm Hg and a diastolic reading of less than 80 mm Hg. Elevated blood pressure and hypertension increase the risk of vascular damage and decrease oxygenation. The AHA chart (see Table 18.1) demonstrates the blood pressure categories and the readings associated with them.

      <title>Diagnostics</title>
      <para id="para-00012">
        A physical examination by a health care provider with a sphygmomanometer (blood pressure monitor) will identify an elevated blood pressure. A 12-lead ECG (electrocardiogram) can assist in determining if the heart has a normal or abnormal rhythm. Blood work is then obtained to determine factors that contribute to hypertension as well as how the body is reacting to elevated blood pressure. These laboratory tests include a complete blood cell count (CBC), basic electrolyte panel, cholesterol panel, and renal function. An echocardiogram (EKG), an ultrasound of the heart, is not typically included in diagnostic procedures to determine hypertension; however, the healthcare provider may add this diagnostic study to visualize the heart’s chambers, valves, and pumping action. Diagnosis for hypertension is based on the findings of the physical examination and the diagnostic study results.

      <title>Clinical Manifestations</title>
      <para id="para-00013">
        Symptoms of hypertension may not occur for years, and most of the time the symptoms can be silent. Symptoms typically associated with hypertension include elevated blood pressure readings, headaches, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, and neurological disturbances such as disorientation or a decreased level of consciousness. Over time, uncontrolled hypertension can lead to organ damage, and clients can experience symptoms related to the specific organ that is damaged; for example, with kidney damage the client may experience end stage renal disease (ESRD) and require dialysis.

        <title>Dietary Modification</title>
        <para id="para-00019">
          Clients with hypertension should eat a low-sodium diet consisting of whole grains, vegetables, and fruits. Other recommendations include low-fat dairy products and limiting meat intake to a total of 6 ounces of lean meat, such as fish and poultry, daily. Reducing sweets and red meat is also important. The American Heart Association (2022) recommends 1500 mg to no more than 2300 mg of sodium intake per day. Dietary pattern and nutritional therapy should focus on food preference, social and cultural influences, and appropriate caloric intake.

          Moderate exercise is recommended by the American Heart Association (2022) at least four times a week for adults. Average time for exercise should be at least 30–40 minutes per session to assist in decreasing blood pressure. If the client cannot do 30–40 minutes of moderate exercise four times a week, suggest an alternate exercise plan, emphasizing that some physical activity is better than no physical activity. Physical activity and exercise enhance weight reduction and promote a healthy lifestyle. A weight reduction of at least 10 kg can reduce blood pressure by 5 to 20 mm Hg (Ghadieh, 2015).

        <para id="para-00021">
          Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of coronary artery disease. Smoking increases sympathetic nervous system activity, and therefore increases blood pressure, heart rate, and myocardial contractility. Smoking cessation can decrease the risk of coronary artery disease by more than 30% (Luehrs et al., 2021).
        </para>
        <para id="para-00022">
          Alcohol consumption increases blood pressure by increasing the level of the hormone renin in the blood. Renin decreases fluid elimination and leads to higher fluid volume in the body, which therefore increases blood pressure. A reduction of alcohol consumption has been shown to decrease both systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure by 5 to 12 mm Hg (Wake, 2021).

        <term id="term-00016">Angina</term> (also called angina pectoris) is defined as discomfort in the front of the chest, neck, shoulders, jaw, or arms that is precipitated by physical exertions and relieved by rest or sublingual nitrates (Timmis &amp; Roobottom, 2015). Angina is caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. There are four types of angina (Mayo, 2022):
        <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00002">
          <item>Stable angina is the most common form. It occurs during activity and goes away with rest. Stable angina is predictable and follows a pattern similar to the previous episodes of chest pain.</item>
          <item>Unstable angina is unpredictable and considered a medical emergency. Unlike stable angina, it does not follow a pattern similar to previous episodes of chest pain, and episodes last longer than stable angina episodes. If blood flow to the heart doesn’t improve, a myocardial infarction (heart attack) may occur.</item>
          <item>Variant (Prinzmetal) angina is caused by a spasm in the hearts arteries and can occur at rest. This type of angina often occurs in cycles, and may occur at rest or overnight.</item>
          <item>Refractory angina is frequent episodes of angina that occur despite lifestyle changes and medication.</item>
        </list>
        Risk factors for angina include age, family history, tobacco use, diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, obesity, emotional stress, and drug misuse (Mayo, 2022).

          Pharmacologic treatment for angina is individualized. Client lifestyle as well as social and cultural influences impact the health care provider’s choice of drug. The goal for pharmacologic treatment of stable angina is to prevent an ischemic event, such as myocardial ischemia (heart attack), from occurring. Nitrates are the first line of treatment for angina, along with beta-adrenergic blockers and calcium channel blockers (Rousan &amp; Thadani, 2019). These drugs will be discussed further in this chapter.
