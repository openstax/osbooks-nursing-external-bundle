<para id="para-00002">Many factors influence the health of individuals and communities. A <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">barrier</term> is a circumstance or obstacle that keeps people from progressing toward achieving a positive health outcome. Barriers to health promotion and disease prevention exist at various levels, including the individual level, family level, system level, and community or population level. The health care setting may even present barriers. On the other hand, communities provide many opportunities for health promotion and disease prevention, particularly within health care. Nurses who understand barriers can capitalize on available opportunities.</para>

<title>Barriers to Health Promotion and Disease Prevention</title>
<para id="para-00003">It is necessary to be aware of barriers to plan to overcome them for clients or populations. These include barriers to economic stability, access to high-quality education, and access to quality health care. Other barriers are related to neighborhood and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">built environment</term> and to social and community contexts. These barriers can also contribute to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">health disparities</term>, as described in <link document="m00146">Chapter 9, Health Disparities and Inequities</link>. As discussed, the SDOH are barriers that can prevent an individual from obtaining the resources they need to achieve better health outcomes and improved quality of life (Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society, 2020). (See <link document="m00140">Chapter 8, Social Determinants Affecting Health Outcomes</link>.) <link target-id="table-00001" document="m00182"/> provides individual and system-level examples of barriers to health promotion and disease prevention that may occur within each area of the SDOH.</para>

<title>Barriers to Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Within a Health Care Delivery System</title>
<para id="para-00006">The structure of health care delivery systems is made up of internal and external factors that can influence health promotion and disease prevention, therefore impacting health outcomes. Internal factors include everything within the environment in which health care services are provided as well as the resources required for providing those services. These include, but are not limited to, leadership styles, organizational culture, policies and procedures, and information sharing. External factors include government’s role in health care, community expectations and influences, ownership of the health care system, and the extent of services the system provides.</para>
<para id="para-00007">A nurse serving in a role related to health promotion and disease prevention may encounter internal or external barriers from the health care system. The system may lack financial or political support for health promotion implementation. There may be a lack of time for effective health promotion and disease prevention activities, particularly in competition with the day-to-day demands. Poor communication may exist between the various entities within and outside the health care system. Finally, others within the system may lack interest in health promotion and disease prevention (Rogers et al., 2021).</para>

<title>Factors that Influence Participation in Health Promotion Activities</title>
<para id="para-00012">How individuals and populations define health and health problems, and their perception of health’s importance, influence any attempts to improve their health through health promotion activities. Three factors either support or form barriers to participation in health promotion activities.</para>
<list id="list-00003">
<item>A <term id="term-00009">predisposing factor</term> includes any characteristics of the individual or population that affect personal motivation to bring a change in behavior, including their knowledge, beliefs, values, attitudes, and norms. An example of a predisposing factor leading to a positive health outcome would be the belief that smoking is harmful to health.</item>
<item><term id="term-00010">Reinforcing factors</term> occur in the form of positive or negative feedback, such as rewards or punishments and the influence of a peer, teacher, family, or other person or group perceived as important (<link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00182"/>). Continued receipt of feedback can motivate repetition of behavior. Using the smoking example, a reinforcing factor leading to a negative health outcome would be peer pressure to smoke.</item>
<item><term id="term-00011">Enabling factors</term> are social and environmental factors that facilitate or motivate attainment of specific behaviors, such as ease of access, availability, health-related laws, resources, and skills. An example of an enabling factor that leads to a negative health outcome would be the easy availability of cigarettes when other members of the family smoke. <link target-id="table-00002" document="m00182"/> provides additional descriptions and examples of these factors.</item>

<title>Opportunities for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Across Health Care Settings</title>
<para id="para-00015">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">Ottawa Charter</term> first introduced the term “health promotion setting.” A <term id="term-00013">health promotion setting</term> is defined as a place or social context where daily activities occur and various factors interact to influence health and well-being. It involves actively using and shaping the environment to address health-related issues. This is distinct from using a setting solely for delivering specific services or programs. Typically, settings have physical boundaries, defined roles for people, and an organizational structure (WHO, 2021b, p. 30). Health promotion settings exist in cities, hospitals, schools, universities and colleges, and workplaces (Kokko &amp; Baybutt, 2022).

<title>Urban Health Inequities</title>
<para id="para-00016">Data on urban health inequities, or disparities in health outcomes among and within cities, has been extensively documented worldwide, spanning countries and regions, irrespective of their economic development and health care infrastructure. These disparities reflect the overarching disparities in the social determinants of health including economic conditions, education, the physical and built environment, and the quality and accessibility of health care. To promote health equity, nurses must tailor their health promotion and disease prevention efforts to the specific location and the population being served.</para>

<para id="para-00018">Prisons, the digital environment (including social media), and more recently airports, places of worship, and specific coastal communities in the United Kingdom are other identified health promoting settings (Kokko &amp; Baybutt, 2022). Global initiatives to address the health of those who work and live in prisons, particularly in the United Kingdom, have provided benefits from the development of a “whole-prison approach” to health promotion. This approach involves peer support for both workers and prisoners, behavior modification initiatives, disease prevention and screening, easily accessible information about health services and current health campaigns, and a focus on continuity of care (Woodall &amp; Freeman, 2019). This approach has not been adopted in the United States. However, the CDC (2022) does offer recommendations and guidance for correctional settings, including information on infectious disease, COVID-19 management, traumatic brain injury, and other medical problems and conditions reported by prison inmates.</para>
<para id="para-00019">The WHO (2021a) issued its <emphasis effect="italics"><link url="https://openstax.org/r/whointdocs" window="new">Global Strategy on Digital Health 2020–2025</link></emphasis>, which provided guiding principles, strategic objectives, a framework for action, and implementation principles for the strategy and action plan related to using digital technologies to shape the future of global health. This strategy incorporates the use of a variety of technologies to create a continuum of care (WHO, 2021a, p. 8). The WHO (2023b) has also convened a panel of experts to address infodemic management and social listening. An <term id="term-00014">infodemic</term> is an overabundance of information, including misinformation, that surges during a health emergency. The WHO recognizes that during a health emergency, people seek, receive, process, and act on information differently than in other times, making it even more important to use evidence-based strategies to address health issues. <term id="term-00015">Social listening</term> is the process of gathering information about people’s questions and concerns and the circulating narratives and misinformation about health from online and offline data sources. This includes data from social media platforms. The WHO (2023b) hopes to provide an ethical framework and tools that can be used for social listening and infodemic management.</para>

<para id="para-00021">Over 400 airports of various sizes prioritized health and safety during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic by becoming accredited or participating in the Airports Council International (ACI, 2023) <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">Airport Health Accreditation (AHA) program</term>. These airports, including a number in the United States, implemented airport industry best practices to ensure an airport-centric approach to health requirements. Moving forward, the program has moved to the Public Health and Safety Readiness (PHSR) accreditation, which considers a wider range of health emergencies that may lead to air travel concerns (ACI, 2023). A variety of research has also been performed investigating the benefits of health promotion in places of worship (Kwon et al., 2017; Tomalin et al., 2019; Woodard et al., 2020) and determined that faith-based organizations and places of worship can play a vital role in health promotion, particularly for Black, Asian, and minority ethnic communities.</para>
<para id="para-00022">Finally, a setting for health promotion can be even larger than a city. The United Kingdom House of Commons (2022) has identified, through a 2021 Chief Medical Officer’s report, that English coastal communities have a higher disease burden across physical and mental health conditions as well as lower health outcomes including life expectancy, healthy life expectancy, and disability-free life expectancy. In particular, there are worrying trends in public-health-related outcomes for children and young people. As a result, the Royal College of Physicians and others are encouraging a national strategy to improve the health of these coastal communities.</para>
<para id="para-00023">No consensus exists on a single setting that is best for health promotion. In contrast, it is abundantly clear that there are a variety of settings around which individuals and groups live, grow, work, and age that are appropriate for health promotion and disease prevention activities. Settings can be as small as an office and as large as a country, but collaboration and coordination of all entities involved can lead to improvement of health outcomes.</para>

<title>Chapter Summary</title>
<para id="para-00024">Many factors that influence the health of individuals and communities include both individual- and system-level barriers, described using the social determinants of health (SDOH). The health care delivery system also poses barriers to health promotion and disease prevention. Predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing factors can be supportive or produce obstacles, and the health care professional must consider these in their efforts to promote health and prevent disease. Various health promotion settings include cities, hospitals, schools, universities and colleges, workplaces, and others. Many successful health promotion and disease prevention programs encourage collaboration and coordination across multiple settings.</para>
