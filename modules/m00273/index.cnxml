<para id="para-00002">A <term id="term-00001">nonopioid analgesic</term> refers to any pharmacologic agent that treats the symptoms of pain and does not involve activation of opioid receptors. These agents generally work by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX), a major pro-inflammatory enzyme that causes many signs and symptoms of inflammation, including redness, swelling, and sensitization of nociceptors, thereby increasing the transmission of painful signals to the brain. COX causes this increase in inflammation and pain by increasing the production of cytokines such as prostaglandins, prostacyclin, and thromboxane. It is also partly responsible for the pyrexia that occurs with infection, which is why many nonopioid analgesics that block the activity of COX also work as <term id="term-00002">antipyretics</term> to reduce fever.</para>
<para id="para-00003">Cyclooxygenase has two major isoforms: COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 helps with normal homeostatic functions in the body, including maintaining normal platelet and renal functions. It also is important for producing prostaglandins that stimulate production of the mucosal barrier that protects the stomach from its own acids. If COX-1 is inhibited through the actions of medications such as glucocorticoids or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), this protective barrier can erode, which is a major cause of peptic ulcers. COX-2 is responsible for much of the inflammation and pain brought about by tissue injury.</para>
<para id="para-00004">Other nonopioid analgesics may serve as adjunctive agents for treating neuropathic sources of pain. These include antidepressant drugs (e.g., duloxetine, amitriptyline), antiseizure drugs (e.g., carbamazepine, pregabalin), and local anesthetics (e.g., lidocaine and bupivacaine). These are useful because they target the abnormal neuronal function that is the source of neuropathic pain. These medications are covered in their respective chapters, and health care professionals should keep these additional tools in mind to ensure adequate management of this type of pain.</para>

<section id="sect-00003">
<title>Acetaminophen</title>
<para id="para-00005">Acetaminophen is a common over-the-counter nonopioid analgesic. It is one of the most popular analgesics due to its low cost, efficacy in treating mild to moderate pain, and excellent safety profile when used within the recommended dosages. Acetaminophen’s complete mechanism of action to relieve pain is not currently known. Some experts theorize that it inhibits COX in the central nervous system (CNS), providing analgesic and antipyretic actions, but notably it does not inhibit COX peripherally, meaning it has no anti-inflammatory action as compared with other nonopioid analgesics.</para>
<para id="para-00006">Acetaminophen comes in a variety of dosage forms, including intravenous and rectal options, to aid clients who cannot take medications by mouth. Acetaminophen is commonly found in combination products with opioid agonists, antihistamines, and medications for coughs and colds. Because acetaminophen is present in so many products, and because its overuse can lead to serious adverse events, nurses must be alert for all sources of acetaminophen that clients may be taking.</para>
<note class="clinical-tip" id="note-00001">
<para id="para-00007"><emphasis effect="bold">Check for All Sources of Acetaminophen</emphasis></para>
<para id="para-00008">Many over-the-counter and prescription medications include acetaminophen, including many cough and cold products. Clients should be aware that they need to count all sources of acetaminophen to ensure they do not exceed the limit of 4,000 mg per 24 hours and put themselves at risk for liver injury.</para>

<section id="sect-00004">
<title>Aspirin, Ibuprofen, and Naproxen Sodium</title>
<para id="para-00009">Aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen sodium are classified as <term id="term-00003">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</term>. This classification means they possess analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory actions without belonging to the group of medications known as the glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone and dexamethasone, which are discussed in <link document="m00301">Introduction to the Immune System and the Inflammatory Response</link>. NSAIDs are often preferred over glucocorticoids as anti-inflammatory agents because they cause fewer adverse drug reactions such as hyperglycemia, hypertension, and increased risk for infection. NSAIDs work by inhibiting the enzyme COX centrally and in peripheral tissues to decrease inflammation and reduce pain. NSAIDs are also very popular analgesics because they are readily available over the counter.</para>
<para id="para-00010">Aspirin is notable for its antiplatelet actions, so it can be used during myocardial infarctions to aid in maintaining coronary blood flow by inhibiting platelet aggregation. (See <link document="m00387">Cardiac Emergency and Shock Drugs</link> for more about aspirin’s use in cardiovascular emergencies.) The reason for aspirin’s unique actions is that it is an irreversible inhibitor of COX in platelets, preventing them from aggregating and initiating the clotting cascade. Aspirin’s irreversible inhibition of COX means that platelets are affected for their entire lifetime, which is approximately 7–10 days. Nurses should instruct clients taking blood thinners (e.g., warfarin, apixaban) to be cautious about using aspirin to treat pain because of increased risk for bleeding and bruising.</para>

<para id="para-00012">Clients reporting severe abdominal pain, dark tarry stools, or vomiting or coughing up of blood should stop using any NSAIDs immediately and be assessed by a health care provider for possible stomach ulcers.</para>

<section id="sect-00005">
<title>Tramadol</title>
<para id="para-00013">Tramadol is a partial opioid receptor agonist and inhibitor of reuptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin. These characteristics make tramadol a potential analgesic option for clients with neuropathic pain because they benefit from both the partial opioid effect and the pain-modulating effects of increased norepinephrine and serotonin. However, due to its actions at the opioid receptors, tramadol has been linked to cases of abuse and addiction, leading the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to categorize tramadol as a Schedule IV medication (CIV). The DEA scheduling of a medication puts certain restrictions on who can prescribe the medication and how much of the medication can be prescribed at a time.</para>

<title>Adverse Effects and Contraindications</title>
<para id="para-00015">Nonopioid analgesics as a class are relatively safe to use for many clients but do carry some notable adverse effects in susceptible individuals. Acetaminophen is a preferred analgesic for mild to moderate pain because it has relatively few adverse effects, but it must not be taken in amounts greater than those recommended by the drug’s manufacturers. This limit is 4000 mg per 24 hours; taking acetaminophen in doses beyond that increases the chances of developing potentially fatal <term id="term-00016">hepatotoxicity</term>. Clients with a history of liver disease will have lower recommended dosages because they are at greater risk for liver injury when using acetaminophen. Hepatotoxicity from acetaminophen can present as nausea, fatigue, and jaundice (yellowish skin and sclera) and may require antidotal therapy with the drug n-acetylcysteine to help prevent further liver injury.</para>
<para id="para-00016">NSAIDs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen sodium are known to increase the risk for bleeding and bruising and can cause kidney injury in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">older adults</term> and in clients with a history of chronic kidney disease. NSAIDs taken at high doses for long periods of time can also potentially cause stomach ulcers that can progress to bleeding and perforation by eroding the protective stomach lining over time.</para>
<para id="para-00017">Due to its opioid receptor activity, tramadol can cause CNS and respiratory depression in overdose or when mixed with other CNS depressants such as alcohol. It is associated with risk for abuse and addiction, and individuals with a history of substance use disorder should avoid it. Tramadol can lower the seizure threshold and should be used with caution in clients with a history of seizure disorder.</para>
<para id="para-00018">NSAIDs carry a risk for asthma exacerbations in clients with a history of aspirin-induced asthma. Aspirin should be avoided in children younger than 16 years old with a recent history of viral illness because the medication may cause a potentially fatal condition called <term id="term-00018">Reye’s syndrome</term>.</para>
<para id="para-00019">All of these agents should be avoided in clients with a known allergy to the individual agents or any of their components.</para>
