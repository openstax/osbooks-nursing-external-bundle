Mass violence often occurs without warning and can happen anywhere, impacting whole communities and the country at large. These types of disasters, which include shootings and acts of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">terrorism</term>, disturb the sense of order and safety in situations that are normally nonthreatening. The impact of mass violence is far-reaching, instilling feelings of confusion, fear, and helplessness. They violate the larger community’s sense of safety and order, affecting even those without personal connections to the event (SAMHSA, n.d.).

    <title>Mass Shootings in the U.S.</title>
    <para id="para-00003">Statistically, mass violence is uncommon, with mass shootings comprising most incidents. There is no standard definition of mass shooting, but there is a common definition for <term id="term-00003">active shooter</term>. An active shooter is an individual (or individuals) who is killing or attempting to kill people with a firearm within an area (USA Facts, 2023). Criteria to report mass shootings differ by the number of victims, whether injuries are included, the location of the shooting, whether it occurred with another crime, and the relationship between the shooter and the victims (Smart &amp; Shell, 2021). More common definitions include an incident where four or more people have been murdered by a firearm or an event where at least four victims were injured or killed by a firearm. Mass shootings are attributed to less than one percent of all firearm deaths annually in the U.S., but they have incited feelings of public fear and panic beyond the direct victims and their families (Soni &amp; Tekin, 2022). The U.S. has seen an increase in the rate of mass shootings and the number of people killed over the last four decades, resulting in over 1,000 deaths and 1,500 injuries (NCMDI, 2019; Soni &amp; Tekin, 2022). While federal funds to study gun violence were largely unavailable for about 20 years, in 2019 the U.S. Congress approved funding for the CDC and National Institutes of Health to conduct gun violence research. This new availability of federal funds opened the door to new research on gun violence, suicide, and injury prevention (Weir, 2021). <link target-id="table-00001" document="m00356"/> provides 2016–2022 statistics, highlighting the recent increase in mass shootings. <link target-id="table-00002" document="m00356"/> compares the outcomes of the deadliest mass shooting incidents in the U.S.</para>

    <title>The Impact of Mass Violence</title>
    <para id="para-00004">Mass violence and shootings have significant mental health effects on population health. These terrifying and traumatic incidents are often directed at strangers in public places. The community’s response is defensive and urgent, demanding an explanation to try to make sense of the nonsensical. In the aftermath of mass violence, political leaders often blame mental illness, a narrative that echoes the public’s common belief that individuals with mental illness generally pose a danger to others. It is difficult to comprehend the logic of mass violence or to imagine that a mentally stable person would intentionally kill multiple strangers; therefore, one might conclude that all perpetrators of mass violence must be mentally ill (NCMDI, 2019). However, according to a report from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the motives for mass violence are complex. The most common reasons relate to grievances, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">ideology</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">bias</term>, political beliefs, and psychotic behavior (Alathari et al., 2023). Some offenders give multiple reasons for committing acts of mass violence, and others, killed during the event, never provide a reason. <link target-id="table-00003" document="m00356"/> outlines cited motivations for mass violence events. Over half are attributed to personal, domestic, or workplace grievances, while only 14 percent are related to psychotic symptoms (Alathari et al., 2023).</para>

    <caption>Motives for mass violence over time (See Alathari et al., 2023.)</caption>
    </table>
    <para id="para-00005">Mental health issues related to mass violence events are correlated to direct victims, their families, and the general population. Research has shown that 48 percent of Americans live with the fear of becoming a victim of a mass shooting, and more than 10 percent have avoided large crowds or bought a weapon because they are worried about the threat of mass shootings (Brenan, 2019). Individuals living in the community or attending the school where a shooting has occurred have increased emotional distress, with a higher likelihood of taking antidepressants, engaging in risky behaviors, or considering suicide (Brodeur &amp; Yousaf, 2022; Deb &amp; Gangaram, 2023).</para>
    <para id="para-00006">Public health and community health nurses and other health providers must be aware of the role of mental illness in mass violence for both victims and offenders to provide support and lead efforts to prevent mass violence (Alathari et al., 2023). Like many other community health concerns, preparation and prevention are key strategies for combating mass violence. Planning and participation in regular preparation activities like active-shooter drills supports proactivity and preparation for the worst-case scenario (Peterson &amp; Densley, 2021).</para>
    <para id="para-00007">A part of preparation, albeit not coordinated, is attention to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">warning signs</term>. Warning signs include having behavioral problems or difficulty connecting with others, being noncommunicative, having aggressive or violent verbalizations, being withdrawn, harming self or others, and being emotionally unstable (Peterson &amp; Densley, 2021). Education and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">advocacy</term> programs for teachers, caregivers, and the public can go a long way in promoting awareness of behaviors that might be precursors to violence in individuals. Seemingly innocuous comments or interactions may be warning signs or cries for help (Peterson &amp; Densley, 2021).</para>

    <title>Mass Casualty Management</title>
    <para id="para-00008"><term id="term-00008">Mass casualty incidents (MCIs)</term> are human-made or natural disasters that overwhelm the resources of local management agencies and the health care system. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">Emergency medical services (EMS)</term> are often the first responders on the scene of a mass casualty event, but the principles of response apply to any health care responder. First responders are critical in triaging, stabilizing, and preparing to transport victims to health care facilities after MCIs. As the name implies, MCIs involve large numbers of victims who will need varying levels of care. Effective management, communication, and collaboration are essential during an MCI. Local community agencies, such as the fire department or police department, may respond, and state or national agencies may also become involved, depending on the type and severity of an MCI (Alpert &amp; Kohn, 2023). </para>
    <para id="para-00009">Response to a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">mass casualty event</term> is complex, involving many people from different disciplines. Planning is a critical step to response, as a methodical approach to a crisis engages community responders in thinking through the lifecycle of a potential crisis, determining required capabilities, and establishing a framework for roles and responsibilities (FEMA, 2021). Since mass casualty disasters can happen without warning, a constant state of readiness requires training and regular drills. Simulations are frequently used to prepare health care workers and first responders for mass casualty management, as individuals must understand the roles that each one has in mass casualty response (<link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00356"/>).</para>

    <item>The top priority on the scene of an MCI is the safety of the responders. Verifying that the scene is safe before first responders provide care prevents secondary incidents and subsequent injuries (Alpert &amp; Kohn, 2023). Scene security and the responsible agency will depend on the nature of the MCI. If the event is a vehicular accident, the environment around the scene should be assessed for fuel leakage, fire hazard, and other risks that would further endanger victims or responders.</item>
    <item>Appropriate <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">personal protective equipment (PPE)</term> needs to be available and used by responders to a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear event.</item>
    <item>In response to a terrorist or mass violence attack, the possibility of explosive detonation or suicide bomber should be considered, and bomb disposal experts dispatched before responders begin lifesaving measures.</item>
    <item>In a mass shooting incident, if the offender has not been apprehended or has fled the scene, first responders must not approach the scene unless they have training in tactical medicine and are wearing appropriate protective gear.</item>

    <title>Chapter Summary</title>
    <para id="para-00016">Mass violence is an intentional criminal act targeted at defenseless citizens with the intent to harm or kill in large number. Mass shootings make up the majority of mass violence events, with the number of incidences rising. Mass violence negatively impacts communities through loss of life, injury, decreased feelings of community safety, and increased mental health issues. Nurses must be prepared to recognize signs of potential violence and be able to respond to mass casualty events. Mass casualty management is complex and requires multiagency, interprofessional collaboration, efficient organization and communication, scene safety assessment, and zoning of care areas.</para>
