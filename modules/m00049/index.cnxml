  <title>Normal Function of the Cardiovascular System</title>
  <para id="para-00002">The <term id="term-00001">cardiovascular system</term> includes the heart, blood, blood vessels, lymph, lymphatic vessels, and glands that move blood and lymph through the body. Assessment of this system involves the mechanical and electrical functions of the heart and blood vessels and their effectiveness at circulating blood throughout the body. Assessment should also include an examination of a client’s nutritional status.</para>
  <para id="para-00003">The cardiovascular system’s primary role is to circulate blood throughout the body. The components of this system include the heart, known as the cardiac muscle, and blood vessels. The blood vessels include the <term id="term-00002">arteries</term>, which carry oxygenated blood from the heart to other parts of the body; <term id="term-00003">veins</term>, which carry deoxygenated blood from the body to the heart; and <term id="term-00004">capillaries</term>, tiny blood vessels with thin walls where arteries and veins exchange blood supply.</para>
  <para id="para-00004">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">heart</term> has two components—the electrical conduction system and the mechanical working component—that work together to effectively pump blood and maintain proper <term id="term-00006">perfusion</term>, or movement of blood, oxygen, and nutrients to tissues in the body. The electrical system sends an impulse to the excitable cardiac tissue cells and triggers them to mechanically contract in a specific pattern to push blood throughout the body.</para>
  <para id="para-00005">Nutrition can heavily impact the heart’s ability to complete the task of pumping blood. Like other muscles in the body, the heart requires electrolytes to produce action-potential impulses in muscles. The electrical charge that sends an impulse to the heart to trigger contraction is highly dependent on the involuntary process of potassium and sodium ion exchange (Balchem, 2021). Likewise, muscles, including the heart, are dependent on calcium and magnesium ion exchange for physical contraction or movement (Balchem, 2021). Low levels of these electrolytes can result in dysrhythmias and ineffective cardiac output and perfusion.</para>
  <para id="para-00006">For the mechanical working component of the heart to function properly, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">cardiac muscle</term> must be supplied with oxygen and nutrients from the coronary arteries. The cardiac muscle must also be in good physical working condition and able to receive impulses from the heart’s electrical conduction system. The mechanical working component is not necessary for the electrical conduction system to function; but, without the mechanical working component, no blood is pumped through the body—and if the electrical conduction system is functioning independently, there will only be <term id="term-00008">pulseless electrical activity (PEA)</term>, or electrical conduction throughout the heart without physical movement of the heart muscle.</para>
  <para id="para-00007">Another consideration is the vascular portion of the cardiovascular system. While the heart requires electrolytes to create electrical impulses to trigger contractions strong enough to circulate blood throughout the body, it may still be unable to adequately perfuse the body if the vessels are blocked or become hardened, as in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">arteriosclerosis</term>. The primary cause of this disease is a nutritional intake high in unhealthy fats and cholesterol. When low-density lipid (LDL) cholesterol levels are chronically high, fatty deposits known as plaques form in artery walls and reduce blood flow through that vessel (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, 2023). When the heart is forced to push against the increased pressure from the less-elastic and smaller diameter of the diseased vessels, it causes the heart muscle to continually be overworked. The heart muscle can become damaged, and the eventual result can be heart failure.</para>
  <para id="para-00008">The other consideration in normal function of the heart is the pressure it exerts against the vessel walls when contracting and relaxing, known as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">blood pressure</term>. When blood pressure is chronically high, the client has an increased risk of heart failure. Blood pressure is largely regulated in the body by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) that utilizes fluid and electrolytes, especially sodium (Martyniak and Tomasik, 2022). This system works to change the sodium concentration in the blood to raise or lower blood pressure as needed by the body (Martyniak and Tomasik, 2022). When the concentration of sodium is chronically high due to excessive intake and is not able to be excreted by the kidneys, the RAAS system is unable to adequately control blood pressure.</para>
  <para id="para-00009">There are two main <term id="term-00011">circulatory systems</term> of interconnected blood vessels that flow through the body: the systemic circulatory system and the pulmonary circulatory system. The systemic system provides blood to the body’s tissues, organs, and cells, and the pulmonary system transports blood between the heart and lungs allowing for oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange to occur (Sherrell, 2021).</para>
  <para id="para-00010">Through the circulation of blood, the cardiovascular system performs several other functions. Blood is considered a “fluid connective tissue” (Visible Body, 2023), and it supports, protects, and gives structure to the blood vessels. Blood provides numerous other functions, including:</para>

  <title>Assessment of Nutrition and the Function of the Cardiovascular System</title>
  <para id="para-00011">A thorough assessment of the nutritional status of a client’s cardiovascular system involves examining each component. Many diseases are associated with a lack of nutrition. The most effective method of determining whether nutrition is a contributing factor is to evaluate each component individually. Note that the electrical conduction system and the mechanical working component should be assessed separately.</para>

  <title>Assessing Electrical Conduction System of the Heart</title>
  <para id="para-00012">The normal electrical pattern of the heart (<link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00049"/>) starts with the initiation of an impulse at the <term id="term-00012">sinoatrial node (SA node)</term>, the pacemaker of the heart. The impulse then travels through the <term id="term-00013">atria</term>, the top two heart chambers, causing atrial contraction, down to the <term id="term-00014">atrioventricular node (AV node)</term>, an electrical gatekeeper that controls a delay between the atrial and ventricular impulse, allowing blood to fill the ventricle. From the AV node, the impulse travels to the <term id="term-00015">bundle of His</term>, a bundle of conducting fibers that branch to each ventricle, then down both bundle branches to the <term id="term-00016">Purkinjean fibers</term>, or terminal-conducting fibers in the ventricles. This action causes the <term id="term-00017">ventricles</term>, or bottom chambers of the heart, to contract (Johns Hopkins Medicine, 2023b).</para>

  <para id="para-00013">An <term id="term-00018">electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG)</term> or telemetry can be used to evaluate the electrical conduction of the heart. An ECG is a recording of a heart’s electrical activity through electrodes placed on the chest to capture signals. <term id="term-00019">Telemetry</term> is the continual measurement of a heart’s ECG through a portable device that automatically transmits the reading to a monitor.</para>

  <para id="para-00015">For the heart to be in optimal health, the electrical conductivity should be a <term id="term-00020">normal sinus rhythm (NSR)</term>. An NSR is a rhythm that originates from the sinus node and is characteristic of a healthy heart’s cardiac rhythm.

In addition, the waves should be consistent and resemble each other. <link target-id="table-00001" document="m00049"/> outlines the telemetry wave components, normal measurement, existence in the cardiac cycle, and the expected shape and deflection.</para>

  <title>Assessing the Mechanical Working Component of the Heart and the Blood Vessels</title>
  <para id="para-00017">A healthy heart represents the flow of an adequate blood supply, proper stimulation through the electrical system, and effectiveness at physically pumping blood through the body. Normal blood flow through the heart starts when deoxygenated blood is returned to the heart from the body via the superior vena cava. It travels through the right atrium, through the tricuspid valve, and into the right ventricle. The blood is then pumped through the pulmonary valve and into the pulmonary artery to be re-oxygenated in the lungs (<link target-id="fig-00003" document="m00049"/>). Once the blood has gone through the exchanges needed and is oxygenated, it returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins into the left atrium. It will then travel through the mitral valve into the left ventricle, through the aortic valve into the aorta, and out to the body for use (Pediatric Heart Specialists, 2023).</para>
  <figure class="scaled-down" id="fig-00003"><media alt="A diagram of the heart shows how deoxygenated blood flows into the heart, is re-oxygenated in the lungs, and then out to the body for use."><image mime-type="image/png" src="../../media/NUT_Figure_11_00_004.png"/></media>

  <para id="para-00018">The oxygenated blood is returned to the body through two types of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00023">arteries</term>. Elastic arteries are located closer to the heart and are more flexible than <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">muscular arteries</term>. Muscular arteries contain smoother muscle and are farther away from the heart. Both types of arteries must have strong walls, because arteries handle higher pressures from the blood being pumped out of the heart (Cleveland Clinic, 2023b). The main function of arteries is to distribute the oxygenated blood to all body organs and tissues, including the heart itself, through the coronary arteries. Refer to <link target-id="fig-00004" document="m00049"/> for a visual of the artery wall.</para>

  <para id="para-00019">As blood travels through the body via the arteries, the arteries get smaller in diameter until they terminate into <term id="term-00025">arterioles</term>, the smallest arteries. These arterioles link with capillaries and then connect to <term id="term-00026">venules</term>, the smallest veins (Gupta and Shea, 2022). Capillaries are thin-walled vessels that connect arterioles and venules. As shown in <link target-id="fig-00005" document="m00049"/>, they are the vehicle for the final exchange of oxygen and nutrients into tissues and wastes into the blood (Gupta &amp; Shea, 2022).</para>
  <figure class="scaled-down" id="fig-00005"><media alt="Blood from the heart flows into the arteriole and then the capillary.

  <para id="para-00020">After passing through the capillaries and venules, blood continues into the veins on the way back to the heart. Veins have thinner walls than arteries, because pressures are lower in this portion of the cardiovascular system. Veins also dilate in response to fluid. Some veins, like the large veins in the legs, have valves in them to prevent blood from back flowing (Gupta &amp; Shea, 2022). Once blood has traveled through the veins, it ends up in the heart to start the cycle all over again.</para>
