  <title>Vitamin Function</title>
  <para id="para-00002">The human body obtains <term id="term-00001">vitamins</term>—nutrients the body needs in small amounts to function and stay healthy—in two ways: food and supplementation. Vitamins were first referred to as “accessory factors” that were present in food in small amounts but essential for health. It was not until the start of the 20th century that these factors were named vitamins and, at the beginning of the 21st century, became a multibillion-dollar industry, with over 50 percent of Americans saying they regularly take vitamins of some variety. (Mishra et al., 2021)</para>
  <para id="para-00003">Vitamins are separated into two classes: fat-soluble and water-soluble. <term id="term-00002">Fat-soluble vitamins</term> (A, D, E, and K) are absorbed along with fats in the diet and are stored in the body’s fatty tissue and liver. These vitamins play critical roles in vision, bone health, immune function, and coagulation. <term id="term-00003">Water-soluble vitamins</term> (all other vitamins besides A, D, E, and K) are dissolved in water. Excess intake of water-soluble vitamins is excreted in the urine.</para>
  <para id="para-00004">All vitamins are found naturally in foods and have specific functions. In general, vitamins play the following essential roles (Fletcher, 2019):</para>

  <title>Vitamins A, D, E, and K</title>
  <para id="para-00005">Fat-soluble vitamins include vitamins A, D, E, and K. Fat-soluble vitamins play essential roles in many physiological processes, such as vision, bone health, immune function, and blood clotting (Reddy &amp; Jialal, 2022). Fat-soluble vitamins, like dietary fat, are absorbed through the lymphatic system and then released into the blood, carried by transport proteins. Because these vitamins are stored, daily intake is not required. Excess intake of fat-soluble vitamins, as found with some supplements, can cause <term id="term-00004">toxicity</term>—side effects from taking large doses of supplements or medications.</para>
  <para id="para-00006">Absorption of fat-soluble vitamins occurs in the small intestine where they are mixed with bile salts, fatty acids, and phospholipids; absorbed by chylomicrons (microproteins); and, carried to the lymphatic system. Since all vitamins require carrier proteins for transportation across the lipid bi-layer, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">absorption</term> can be affected adversely by a genetic abnormality in the transport molecules (Ofoedu et al., 2021).</para>
  <para id="para-00007">Vitamin A is active in the genetic development of retinol pigments and contributes to healthy bones, teeth, and soft tissue. Vitamin A also plays a role in reproduction, facilitating semen production and cell differentiation in fetal development. Vitamin A is critical in immune function, helping to grow the cells that produce the mucus that lines the gastrointestinal tracts, sinuses, and genitourinary tract. This mucus traps and protects the human body from the myriad bacteria it encounters daily. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">Beta-carotene</term>—a precursor to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">vitamin A</term>—is an <term id="term-00008">antioxidant</term> that protects against certain cancers and aging by stabilizing <term id="term-00009">free radicals</term>; a free radical is an unstable molecule made during normal cell metabolism that has one unpaired electron (<link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00013"/>).</para>
  <figure class="scaled-down" id="fig-00001"><media alt="Illustration of a free radical next to an antioxidant. In both, two circles of electrons are arranged around a nucleus. An electron from the antioxidant is donated to an unpaired electron in the free radical."><image mime-type="image/jpg" src="../../media/NUT_Figure_03_01_002.png"/></media>

  <para id="para-00008">Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that closely resembles a hormone’s functions. This vitamin can trigger effects in tissue throughout the body, turning on and off the production of proteins. Vitamin D, like vitamin A, plays a role in immunity by promoting the secretion of infection-fighting substances found in white blood cells (Dimitrov et al., 2021).</para>
  <para id="para-00009">Vitamin D naturally occurs in some foods (fatty fish and egg yolks), is added to others (like milk and orange juice) and is available as a vitamin supplement. Vitamin D is unusual because the body can synthesize it from a cholesterol precursor—7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC)—in the epidermis with the help of ultraviolet light. In addition, vitamin D assists in promoting calcium uptake in the gut and ensures adequate calcium and phosphorus for bone mineralization. Bones can become thin, fragile, and deformed without sufficient <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">vitamin D</term>. Vitamin D prevents <term id="term-00011">rickets</term>, the softening of the bones, which results in bowed legs, and protects against <term id="term-00012">osteoporosis</term>, the loss of bone density, which leads to porous structure (National Institutes of Health [NIH], 2023e).</para>
  <para id="para-00010">Vitamin E, a fat-soluble vitamin, acts as an antioxidant and stops the development of free radicals during fat <term id="term-00013">oxidation</term>. Fat oxidation is a chemical reaction in which a healthy molecule loses or is robbed of one of its electrons, which then produces an unhealthy free radical. In addition to protecting the cell from reactive oxygen species (ROS) (reactive species capable of causing damage to biomolecules), <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">vitamin E</term> helps establish a robust immune system and improves the endothelial cells on the surface of blood vessels, making them more resistant to the adherence of clots (NIH, 2021c).</para>
  <para id="para-00011">Many other claims about vitamin E exist; however, due to the difficulty in establishing biomarkers and correlating them with clinical outcomes, recommendations for vitamin E intake continues to emerge<sup> </sup>(Institute of Medicine [U.S.] Panel on Dietary Antioxidants and Related Compounds, 2000). Recently, the Food and Nutrition Board suggested that vitamin E intake among healthy adults is probably higher than the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) but warns that those following a low-fat diet could experience a deficiency<sup> </sup>(NIH, 2021c).</para>
  <para id="para-00012">Vitamin K, a fat-soluble vitamin, is a <term id="term-00015">coenzyme</term> required for blood clotting and bone metabolism. Vitamin K is present in the liver and other body tissues, including the brain, heart, pancreas, and bone. Compared with other fat-soluble vitamins, minimal amounts of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">vitamin K</term> circulate in the blood due to rapid metabolism and excretion (NIH, 2021d).<sup> </sup>The clinical status of vitamin K should be regularly evaluated in individuals who take anticoagulants or have bleeding disorders. Infants are injected with vitamin K at birth to decrease the risk of a hemorrhagic event (Hand et al., 2022).</para>
  <para id="para-00013">Because fat-soluble vitamins are stored in tissue, higher amounts of these vitamins result in toxicity. In some water-soluble vitamins, high-potency supplementation can also result in adverse health issues (<link target-id="table-00001" document="m00013"/>).</para>

  <title>B Vitamins</title>
  <para id="para-00014">This section outlines water-soluble vitamins, which includes the family of B vitamins and vitamin C. There are eight B vitamins (at times referred to as B complex): thiamine (B<sub>1</sub>), riboflavin (B<sub>2</sub>), niacin (B<sub>3</sub>), pantothenic acid (B<sub>5</sub>), pyridoxine (B<sub>6</sub>), biotin (B<sub>7</sub>), folate (B<sub>9</sub>), and cobalamin (B<sub>12</sub>).</para>
  <para id="para-00015">All <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">B vitamins</term> act as coenzymes for catalytic activity and several processes that support every aspect of cellular function, including brain and nervous system functions (Hanna et al., 2022). Although almost all the B vitamins are involved in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">metabolism</term>, one cannot be substituted for another. Therefore, a specific B vitamin deficiency is associated with a specific disease. In general, deficiency diseases related to B vitamins are rare, partly because of the wide availability of these vitamins in everyday food items, but also because B vitamins that are commonly lost in food processing are added back into the food. For example, when the bran and germ are removed from grains, leaving only the endosperm, B vitamins and vitamin E are also removed (<link target-id="fig-00002" document="m00013"/>). Food manufacturers add back the vitamins during <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">food processing</term>. This process is called <term id="term-00020">food enrichment</term> and is subject to government oversight by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (Institute of Medicine [U.S.] Committee on Use of Dietary Reference Intakes in Nutrition Labeling [IOM], 2003; Newman et al., 2020).</para>

  <caption>Energy Production from the Metabolism of Macronutrients with B Vitamin Catalysts</caption>
  </table>
  <para id="para-00017">B vitamins must have macronutrients (carbohydrates, fat, and protein) available for energy production. Taking a vitamin supplement instead of a balanced meal does not provide a substrate for coenzyme action. Instead, obtaining vitamins through foods is preferred. Remember that none of the other B vitamins can cover a deficiency of another.</para>
  </section>
  <section id="sect-00005">
  <title>Choline, Biotin, and Folate</title>
  <para id="para-00018">Other water-soluble substances that are less known include <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00022">choline</term>, biotin, and folate. Choline is an essential nutrient, not classified as a vitamin or a mineral, and is naturally present in food. Choline is often grouped with the B vitamins because it has similar functions. Vitamin research continues to improve classification, and in 2022 for the first time, a set amount, or <term id="term-00023">Daily Value</term>, for choline intake was included in the <term id="term-00024">Daily Values</term> (DVs), the list of all vitamins and minerals needed (FDA, 2022a). This nutrient is a source of methyl groups needed for many steps in lipid metabolism and is required to generate the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Although the body produces some choline endogenously in the liver, the amount is sometimes insufficient; additional choline must be ingested through food sources. Most people in the U.S. consume less than the recommended choline intake, yet a deficiency in healthy, nonpregnant individuals is rare, possibly because of the contribution of self-synthesized choline (NIH, 2022b).</para>
  <para id="para-00019">Biotin is a water-soluble vitamin that works as a cofactor that catalyzes the metabolism of fatty acids, glucose, and amino acids. Biotin is found in many animal and plant foods. There has never been a reported case of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00025">biotin</term> deficiency in a healthy individual consuming a Western diet (NIH, 2022a).</para>
  <para id="para-00020">Folate (B<sub>9</sub> functions as a coenzyme in synthesizing ribonucleic acid (RNA) and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Folate is also critical in the metabolism of amino acids required for normal cell division. A lack of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00026">folate</term> will result in large red blood cells, which is associated with <term id="term-00027">megaloblastic anemia</term>—a condition in which the bone marrow produces unusually large, structurally abnormal, immature red blood cells. (NIH, 2022c). Large doses of folate can result in kidney damage.</para>
  <para id="para-00021">The chemical structure of folate differs from the more commonly known folic acid. Folates are naturally found in foods, although <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">folic acid</term> is the fully oxidized form of the vitamin used in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029">fortified foods</term> and most dietary supplements. Since 1998, the FDA has mandated that food manufacturers add folic acid to “enriched breads, cereals, flours, corn meals, pasta, rice, and other grain products to reduce the risk of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00030">neural tube defects</term> (NTDs)” (NIH, 2022c). NTDs result from a developmental error in the closure of the neural tube early in pregnancy and are one of the most common congenital disabilities in North America (National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2023). The fortification program is estimated to have increased mean folic acid intakes in the U.S. by about 200 mcg/day, a substantial increase. An unintentional consequence of folate fortification is that all people consuming the folate fortified foods receive extra folate, not just women of childbearing age. However, in the older adult, the consumption of folic acid from fortified foods increases the risk of ‘masking’ megaloblastic anemia caused by a vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency (van Gool et al., 2020).</para>
  </section>
  <section id="sect-00006">
  <title>Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid)</title>
  <para id="para-00022">Vitamin C or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00031">ascorbic acid</term>, a water-soluble vitamin, is best known for its coenzyme and antioxidant properties (Abiri &amp;Vafa, 2021). Vitamin C protects cells from premature aging caused by free radicals. Vitamin C stabilizes the cell by accepting or donating an electron. The body is constantly moving electrons around, so <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00032">vitamin C</term> is used in almost every tissue in the body. Free radicals are the leading cause of disease and inflammation, so vitamin C’s ability to neutralize those free radicals (acting as an antioxidant) is central to lowering heart disease and cancer risk.</para>
  <para id="para-00023">Vitamin C also promotes collagen synthesis. Although <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00033">collagen synthesis</term> is required for maintaining normal vascular function, it also provides metabolic substrates for new blood vessel development (<term id="term-00034">angiogenesis</term>), enhancing blood supply, and bringing more oxygen to the tissues. Vitamin C is necessary for a healthy immune system and increases the absorption of non-heme iron.</para>
  <para id="para-00024">The body tightly monitors the plasma concentration of vitamin C. Approximately 70–90% of vitamin C is absorbed in moderate intakes of 30–180 mg/day. Absorption becomes less efficient at doses above 1,000 mg/day, with about 50% of the excess excreted in the urine (NIH, 2021b).<sup> </sup>Most healthy, non-smoking Americans consume enough vitamin C-rich foods to meet the daily requirements of 90 mg/day for males and 75 mg/day for females. According to national nutrition studies, the average vitamin C intake is about 95 mg/day without vitamin supplementation. See <link target-id="table-00003" document="m00013"/> for common fruits and vegetables containing vitamin C.</para>

  <title>Vitamin Intake for Wellness</title>
  <para id="para-00029">To help consumers make healthy food choices and consume adequate amounts of vitamins, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00051">FDA</term> mandates that foods carry a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00052">nutrition facts food label</term>. Although the label does not display every vitamin or mineral, <link target-id="fig-00003" document="m00013"/> is an example nutrition food label, outlining the most important nutrient information deemed by the FDA (2022a).</para>
  <figure class="scaled-down" id="fig-00003"><media alt="A nutrition facts food label provides the serving information, calories per serving, and percent daily value of the food item, per serving. The percent daily value for each nutrient is highlighted."><image mime-type="image/jpg" src="../../media/NUT_Figure_03_01_004.jpg"/></media>
  <caption>This nutrition facts food label shows percent DVs of one serving (1 cup) of a food item. (credit: “Sample Label for Frozen Lasagna”/U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Public Domain)</caption></figure>
  <para id="para-00030">The nutrition facts food label in <link target-id="fig-00003" document="m00013"/> indicates that this food item is low in added sugars and vitamin D and is considered high in saturated fat, calcium, and sodium. Restated more simply, one serving of this food item provides one-quarter of the daily calcium and saturated fat requirements and over one-third of the daily allowance for sodium, if consuming approximately 2,000 calories daily. Usually, a meal consists of more than one food item, so adding naturally low-sodium and low-fat foods like fresh fruit or vegetables will help to balance this food nutritionally.</para>
  <para id="para-00031">Individual food manufacturers create nutrition facts labels based on the amount of nutrients in a standard serving size of that food. The <term id="term-00053">percent Daily Value</term> (DV) is the percentage of the nutrient the food item provides for an adult consuming about 2,000 calories daily. FDA guidance states that 5% DV or less of a nutrient per serving is considered low, and 20% DV or more of a nutrient per serving is considered high (FDA, 2022). Note that reaching 100% of the DV for sugar, fat, saturated fat, and sodium should not be a target or goal.</para>

  <title>Part A</title>
  <para id="para-00033">Read the following clinical scenario and then answer the questions that follow. This case study will evolve throughout the chapter.</para>
  <para id="para-00034">Curtis, a third grader who has a long history of being a picky eater, does not like getting up early, so most days he does not eat breakfast before leaving for school. He also does not like the school-provided lunch, so his Auntie sends him to school with a commercially packaged and processed lunch of cheese and meat with crackers. After school, Curtis has a two-pack of toaster pastries with a glass of water, and his mom or Auntie usually makes him a box of macaroni and cheese for supper—they know he will eat it without a complaint. During his last visit to the pediatrician, Curtis’s mom voiced frustration with Curtis’s eating habits and wondered if he was getting all his vitamins and minerals. After checking Curtis’s height and weight, the pediatrician explained that Curtis was at the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile for weight and advised Mom to serve more fruits and vegetables and monitor his weight. Mom conveyed this information to Auntie, Curtis’s primary caregiver.</para>
  <para id="para-00035">To answer the following questions, search the Internet for food label information on a combo lunch pack (such as Lunchables), boxed macaroni and cheese, and toaster pastries.</para>

  <title>Meal Planning</title>
  <para id="para-00038">Cooking techniques can impact the retention of water-soluble vitamins. The best <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00054">cooking techniques</term> for preserving <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00055">water-soluble vitamins</term> in vegetables include stir-frying, microwaving, and steaming. Each of these limits the amount of water and shortens cooking time, which decreases lost vitamins.</para>
  <para id="para-00039">Vitamins B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, and folate are sensitive to heat or light. Exposure to heat for as little as five minutes can decrease the content of the vitamin by as much as 90%. Vitamin C is degraded by heat and can begin to decrease within five minutes of exposure to a high temperature. For the best retention of a vitamin, cook for a shorter time, use less water, and lower the temperature.</para>
  <para id="para-00040">Another way of maximizing vitamin intake is through intentional <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00056">meal planning</term>. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00057">MyPlate</term> from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is a simple tool for building a meal rich in vitamins and minerals that focuses on nuts, legumes, fruits, vegetables, complex carbohydrates, lean meat, and dairy. Another effective way to present a balanced and nutrient-rich meal is to create a plate of one-quarter protein, one-quarter high carbohydrate or starchy food, and one-half fruits and vegetables.</para>
