<title>Leadership Behaviors That Foster Health Equity</title>
<para id="para-00003">This text has emphasized social justice and health equity. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">Nurse leaders</term> have an opportunity and an obligation to lend their skills as scientists, innovators, advocates, and educators to lead efforts to advance health equity for all (Azar, 2021). A nurse leader does not have to be in a position of authority; instead, they can carry an informal role of influence. For example, nurses can act as role models by embodying equity, inclusivity, and cultural competence principles. They can demonstrate respectful and compassionate care for all individuals regardless of their backgrounds or social determinants of health. By modeling inclusive behavior, nurses inspire others to follow suit. Nurses can lead initiatives to ensure the nursing staff receives ongoing training and education in cultural humility and sensitivity and advocate for language services and interpreter services to ensure effective communication and understanding. <link target-id="table-00001" document="m00372"/> demonstrates how nurses, as informal leaders, can use their influence and expertise to improve the population’s health.

<title>Health in All Policies</title>
<para id="para-00015"><term id="term-00015">Health in All Policies (HiAP)</term> seeks to incorporate health considerations into policymaking across various sectors and government agencies. As described in <link document="m00365">Engagement in the Policy Development Process</link>, HiAP is “a collaborative approach that integrates and articulates health considerations into policymaking across sectors to improve the health of all communities and people” (CDC, 2016a). It recognizes that health outcomes are influenced by various social, economic, and environmental factors extending beyond the health care sector. HiAP aims to ensure that health is considered and integrated into decision-making processes and policies at all levels of government.</para>
<para id="para-00016">HiAP emphasizes addressing health inequities and the underlying SDOH, given that health disparities often stem from unequal access to resources, opportunities, and power. HiAP strongly encourages collaboration among various sectors, including health care, education, transportation, housing, environment, and agriculture. This approach recognizes that addressing SDOH requires a comprehensive, coordinated effort. When these sectors work together, they can align policies, strategies, and actions to promote health and well-being. HiAP aims to address the social, economic, and environmental factors contributing to health inequities and achieve equitable health outcomes for all populations. HiAP stresses integrating health impact assessments, epidemiological data, and research findings into policy development processes, as evidence and data are crucial to informing policymaking (CDC, 2016b).</para>
<para id="para-00017">Collaboration between community and public health nurses and professionals from various sectors and government agencies is crucial for promoting HiAP. By engaging in intersectoral partnerships, community and public health nurses can work with policymakers, community organizations, schools, transportation departments, and housing authorities, and other concerned parties to advocate for policies that address social determinants of health. Community and public health nurses can provide expertise on health promotion, disease prevention, and community needs to inform policy discussions. They can also support the implementation of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">health impact assessments (HIAs),</term> which evaluate the potential health effects of proposed policies, plans, and projects across different sectors. Nurses can contribute their understanding of local health needs, data, and community perspectives to ensure that HIAs are comprehensive and reflect the specific community context. Additionally, they can collect and analyze data on health outcomes, SDOH, and the impact of policies on population health to provide evidence for the effectiveness of HiAP interventions. HIA and HiAP are policy tools that include health considerations in decision-making processes across sectors such as transportation, education, criminal justice, and equity (Rogerson et al., 2020). By sharing this evidence with partners, the community, and public health, nurses can advocate for evidence-based policy changes that promote healthier communities.</para>
<para id="para-00018">Public health nurse Josh can use the data analysis he performed to identify areas within his community to be the focus of intervention. For example, the data revealed a high prevalence of obesity and related chronic conditions, and Josh has identified significant health disparities and inequities, with limited health care, education, and healthy food options characterizing the community. Josh’s examination of interventions attempted in the past reveals that traditional approaches to improving health have not been sufficient and decides to adopt the HiAP framework to address the underlying social determinants of health.</para>
<para id="para-00019">Josh works with the local government and initiates a HiAP team to promote cross-sector collaboration involving representatives from various health, transportation, housing, education, and urban planning departments. Regular meetings and working groups facilitate communication, collaboration, and information sharing. This collaboration ensures that health considerations are integrated into policy discussions across sectors. The HiAP team collects and analyzes a wide range of data related to health outcomes, social determinants of health, and existing policies.</para>
<para id="para-00020">The HiAP team identifies critical health indicators, disparities, and areas where policy interventions can significantly impact health equity. This data-driven approach provides the necessary evidence to guide policy development and implementation. The HiAP team reviews existing policies and identifies opportunities for alignment with health goals. They identify policies that have the potential to impact health determinants, such as transportation infrastructure, affordable housing, access to parks and recreation, and healthy food options. The team works with relevant departments to integrate health considerations into policy development, ensuring that decisions prioritize health equity.</para>
<para id="para-00021">The HiAP team establishes mechanisms to assess the impact of policies on health outcomes and health equity. They track vital indicators, collect data, and evaluate the effects of policy changes on various population groups. This evaluation process helps to identify successes, challenges, and areas for improvement. The findings are shared with policymakers and community partners to inform future decision-making processes.</para>
<para id="para-00022">The local government actively engages with the community throughout the HiAP process. They conduct community consultations, focus groups, and public hearings to ensure that community members’ voices are heard and their health needs are considered in policy development.</para>
<para id="para-00023">Community feedback and perspectives are integrated into policy decisions to ensure relevance and responsiveness to local needs. Through the implementation of HiAP, the city government has witnessed several positive outcomes and impacts. Policies and interventions are designed and implemented with health equity in mind, resulting in improved access to health care services, increased availability of healthy food options, enhanced public transportation systems, and revitalized neighborhoods. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">Health disparities</term> begin to narrow, and community members report improved health outcomes and a sense of well-being.</para>

<title>Community Health Workers</title>
<para id="para-00025">As introduced in <link document="m00200">Implementation and Evaluation Considerations</link>, <term id="term-00018">community health workers</term> (CHWs) are essential public health workers who serve as a critical link between communities, health care systems, and state health departments. CHWs are trusted liaisons between the health care system and its communities. They provide culturally appropriate education, outreach, and support to individuals and families, particularly those facing health care difficulties. They significantly enhance health literacy, facilitate care coordination, and promote preventive health behaviors (CDC, 2022).</para>
<para id="para-00026">For example, CHWs conduct community outreach activities to connect individuals with health care resources and services. They may assist community members in navigating the health care system, scheduling appointments, completing paperwork, accessing insurance coverage, and understanding their rights and responsibilities. CHWs provide emotional support, encourage self-advocacy, and help individuals overcome barriers to health care access (CDC, 2022).</para>
<para id="para-00027">As collaborators with health care providers and other community organizations, the CHW facilitates care coordination for individuals with complex health needs. They help individuals understand their treatment plans, adhere to medications, and navigate the health care system. CHWs also make referrals to resources, such as social services, mental health providers, substance misuse treatment programs, and support groups (CDC, 2022).</para>
<para id="para-00028">CHWs serve as advocates for the health needs of their communities. They raise awareness of health disparities, promote policy changes to address social determinants of health, and engage in community organizing activities. CHWs empower community members to participate in decision-making that actively affects their health and well-being (CDC, 2022).</para>
<para id="para-00029">Community and public health nurses frequently collaborate with CHWs, offering training, supervision, and assistance. This partnership enables public health agencies to utilize CHWs’ cultural proficiency, valuable insights, and strong community ties to develop targeted interventions, enhance health care accessibility, and tackle health disparities effectively. When these groups work together, public health efforts can have a broader reach and more significant impact, ensuring that interventions are tailored to meet the specific needs of the communities they serve.</para>
<para id="para-00030">Some states require certification or training for CHWs, which may be implemented by the Department of Health, Department of Public Health, Department of Human Services, board of nursing, or third-party entities. Certification is often necessary for reimbursement, and some CHWs view it as a tool for career advancement, while others may not see it as necessary for their role or community connection (Rural Health Information Hub, 2023).</para>
