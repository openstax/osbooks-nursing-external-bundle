<title>Complex Carbohydrates and Fiber</title>
<para id="para-00005"><term id="term-00018">Complex carbohydrates</term>, also called <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">polysaccharides</term>, comprise long chains of glucose molecules, creating starch or fiber. The chains of glucose molecules in starch are digestible and are slowly metabolized to a monosaccharide. Fiber is made up of plant substances, such as cellulose, and moves through the digestive system in an undigested form. Fiber is best known for its gastrointestinal health benefits. Research shows that <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020">fiber</term> protects against colorectal cancer, diabetes, diverticulitis, heart disease, inflammatory bowel syndrome, and obesity (Precker, 2022; USDA, 2022). Although the recommended fiber amount varies with age and sex, an estimated 95% of American adults and children do not consume recommended amounts of fiber (Quagliani &amp; Felt-Gunderson, 2016) . The most prudent advice on increasing dietary fiber is to increase high-fiber foods gradually to avoid cramping, gas, and bloating, while ensuring adequate fluid intake. <link target-id="table-00002" document="m00008"/> lists some common foods and their fiber content.</para>

<title>Ultraprocessed Foods</title>
<para id="para-00006">Food not eaten in its original state is considered processed. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00021">Processed food</term> can include something as minimally processed as wheat milled into flour or as complex as a hot dog made from five or more ingredients. It is estimated that <term id="term-00022">ultraprocessed foods</term> (UPFs), commercially produced food products with a long shelf life and usually high in sodium and fat, provide 50–60% of individuals’ total daily energy consumption in some high-income countries (Beslay et al., 2020). During ultraprocessing of grains, they are refined, thereby losing essential nutrients, and sugar and salt are added. Therefore, UPFs are much more likely to have lower amounts of fiber and higher amounts of sugar and salt than their unrefined versions, as well as chemical preservatives, such as nitrates and sulfides, to extend shelf life. <link target-id="table-00003" document="m00008"/> includes examples of how <term id="term-00023">whole foods</term>, or foods in their natural state, are transitioned into UPFs. Research studies on UPF and type 2 diabetes have found that participants with the highest UPF consumption had a higher risk for type 2 diabetes, with a statistically significant dose–response relationship (Llavero-Valero et al., 2021; Seal et al., 2021; Wood et al., 2023).</para>

<caption>Some Whole Foods and Their Transition to Ultraprocessed Foods</caption>
</table>
<para id="para-00007">Nurses can help increase food literacy by holding meaningful discussions with clients about where food comes from and how it is changed as it enters the consumer marketplace. Clients should be able to identify UPFs and understand their relationship to health issues such as obesity, hypertension, and cancer (Fiolet et al., 2018). Creating meal plans with whole and minimally processed foods ensures the consumption of more complex carbohydrates instead of simple sugars.</para>

<section id="sect-00005">
<title>Carbohydrates and Nutrition-Related Disease</title>
<para id="para-00008">When discussing carbohydrate-related diseases with clients, the nurse should always consider the type of carbohydrate and the amount of sugar, fat, and salt added to carbohydrate-rich foods during processing. Carbohydrates should make up 50–65% of caloric intake. However, there is a significant difference in health impact if 50% of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">carbohydrates</term> come from sugar-sweetened beverages and salty snacks instead of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Individuals with a plant-forward philosophy typically consume less meat and more fresh and minimally processed grains, fruits, and vegetables. A <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00025">plant-forward meal plan</term> provides more fiber, less sodium, and, consequently, lower spikes in blood glucose. Research suggests that carbohydrates found in whole foods, especially fiber, promotes health by contributing to good gut microbiota (Clemente-Suarez, 2022). e, Overconsumption of any macronutrient can contribute to weight gain. A regular diet of ultraprocessed carbohydrates has been associated with overweight, obesity, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes (Wood et al., 2023).</para>
<para id="para-00009">Two diets rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats are the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00026">Mediterranean diet</term> and the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00027">Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet (DASH)</term>. The Mediterranean diet is an excellent example of a diet high in complex carbohydrates because it is rich in fruits, vegetables, beans, legumes, nuts, and seeds. The diet also includes fish, seafood, and poultry, as well as dairy products in moderate amounts. This diet is high in omega-3 fatty acids (from fish) and low in fat. The Mediterranean diet can be beneficial because it reduces heart disease, improves serum lipid profiles, and decreases hypertension (Hauser et al., 2022).</para>
<para id="para-00010">Research has shown that the DASH diet can substantially lower blood pressure (Hauser et al., 2022). The DASH diet includes minimally processed foods, and sugary beverages, sweets, and red and processed meats are discouraged. Other research has found that rates of diabetes, cancer, metabolic syndrome, and obesity are lower in individuals following diets like the Mediterranean and DASH diets (Shoaibinobarian et al., 2023).</para>

<section id="sect-00006">
<title>Carbohydrates and Athletes</title>
<para id="para-00012"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">Athletes</term> need increased molecular energy in the form of carbohydrates to sustain their <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029">energy supply</term> during exercise. When someone is exercising, circulating glucose is the first source of energy. This energy source is quickly depleted, and the body then relies on stored <term id="term-00030">glycogen</term>, a large polysaccharide stored in limited amounts in the skeletal muscle and liver. When these stores are depleted, the body metabolizes fat for additional energy. Fat releases energy slower than carbohydrates do and requires over twice as much oxygen to complete the breakdown. Recent research indicates that manipulating fat intake before an athletic event may further increase endurance (Iwayama et al., 2023). Endurance athletes have practiced “<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00031">carbohydrate loading</term>” since the 1960s, which means they deliberately maximize the amount of carbohydrate in their diet approximately three days before a competition (Thomas et al., 2016), thereby enlarging their glycogen stores. diet higher in carbohydrates than usual, coupled with days of no exercise, allows for the maximum buildup of stored energy.</para>

<section id="sect-00007">
<title>Milk Carbohydrate and Lactose Intolerance</title>
<para id="para-00013">People are often surprised to discover that dairy products contain sugar. Lactose, often called “milk sugar,” is a disaccharide composed of galactose and glucose. Breaking down <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00032">lactose</term> into a monosaccharide requires the enzyme <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00033">lactase</term>. Lactase peaks at birth so that infants can digest breast milk. If lactose intolerance is diagnosed, it is not recommended to change to a completely dairy-free diet, as many intolerant patients can tolerate up to 12–15 g of lactose per day without side effects (Catanzaro et al., 2021). Some people do not have this enzyme due to injury or a defect in the small intestine. Lactose intolerance appears to occur more frequently in Africa and Asia, while northern Europeans show better tolerance of lactose-containing foods. In the U.S it is estimated that about 33% of the population has lactose intolerance (Alzahrani et al., 2022).</para>
<para id="para-00014">Without lactase, individuals will develop <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00034">lactose intolerance</term> symptoms such as bloating, gas, and diarrhea. They can take steps to help minimize discomfort and still consume milk-based foods by consuming lactose-free dairy products or taking lactase enzymes before meals to aid digestion. Additional calcium and vitamin D sources should be pursued if clients limit their dairy intake. A possible replacement for these nutrients is plant-based dairy products such as calcium- and vitamin D-fortified almond, rice, soy, hemp, and coconut milk if food allergies are not a concern (Katoch et al., 2022).</para>
</section>
<section id="sect-00008">
<title>Carbohydrates and Blood Glucose</title>
<para id="para-00015">For individuals attempting to stabilize their <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00035">blood sugar</term>, intentional monitoring of food intake is critical, as sugars, starches, and fiber can affect blood glucose levels. Monosaccharides can cause spikes in blood glucose, requiring the hormone insulin to move it into the cells. Starch and fiber cause a less dramatic rise in blood glucose. For healthy adults, whole or minimally processed carbohydrates should supply 50–65% of daily calories. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00036">American Diabetic Association</term> recommends that the percentage of daily carbohydrates be individualized for those with diabetes. Current recommendations include a focus on self-management of diabetes, including individualization of carbohydrate levels based on food preferences and metabolic goals (American Diabetic Association, 2019).</para>
<para id="para-00016">The <term id="term-00037">glycemic index</term> is a tool for better understanding the impact of certain foods on blood sugar. More than 4,000 foods have been ranked based on the availability of highly absorbable monosaccharides (Atkinson et al., 2021). For example, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00038">processed foods</term> made with refined flour and sugar, including cookies, cakes, and candy, have a high glycemic index, whereas whole foods, such as unrefined grains and nonstarchy vegetables, have a lower glycemic index. It is important to note that the glycemic index evaluates only individual foods, not entire meals, and no nutrient qualities are included in the glycemic index rankings (Charles, 2022).</para>
<para id="para-00017">The <term id="term-00039">glycemic load</term> is a newer and more comprehensive approach for assessing the impact of carbohydrates on blood glucose. The glycemic load uses the glycemic index and the number of total carbohydrates in a food serving to predict the timing and rise of blood glucose. It is a more accurate assessment of healthy food intake than the glycemic index alone (Charles, 2022).</para>
