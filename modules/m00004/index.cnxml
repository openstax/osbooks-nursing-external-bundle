<para id="para-00002">It is difficult to separate an individual from the community when assessing personal ability to meet nutritional needs. Factors such as food accessibility, ability to prepare foods, and traditional dietary preferences play a role in how a client can adopt a dietary lifestyle conducive to health and wellness. Government regulations and programs and the availability of appropriate consumer nutritional education can influence these factors.</para>
<para id="para-00003">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">USDA</term> leads 29 agencies that oversee food production and consumption. The USDA (n.d.) recognizes poor nutrition as a substantial factor in illness in the U.S.—poor nutrition is linked to diabetes, obesity, and heart disease. These illnesses impact the nation more broadly by decreasing productivity and increasing health care costs. To foster health, the USDA promotes research to build support and collaboration to provide all Americans equitable access to healthy foods. The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service works to address food insecurity and provide evidence-based nutritional guidance to consumers (USDA Food and Nutrition Service, n.d.).</para>
<para id="para-00004">As part of the USDA’s commitment to connecting all Americans with access to affordable, healthy food, the USDA manages programs designed to provide Americans of limited income or with special needs with healthy food. For example, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00023">Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)</term> provides a monthly allotment for enrollees to purchase certain nutrient-dense foods. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00035">National School Lunch Program (NSLP)</term> provides nutritional, low-cost, or free lunches to eligible school-age children. <link target-id="table-00001" document="m00004"/> lists food assistance programs available through the USDA for qualified individuals.</para>

<para id="para-00005">The USDA also plays an essential role in regulating food production and distribution to ensure food quality and safety. The Food Safety and Inspection Service is the primary USDA agency that enforces safe processing and packing regulations of meat, poultry, and egg products.</para>
<para id="para-00006">The USDA actively promotes nutrition through educational materials.

The MyPlate campaign uses the image of a plate colorfully sectioned into recommended proportions of food for a nutritious meal. Fruits and vegetables comprise half of the plate, grains are approximately one fourth of the plate, and protein occupies the remaining section. Low-fat or fat-free dairy is represented by a glass next to the plate. The MyPlate website encourages everyone to “start simple with MyPlate” and “make every bite count” (USDA, n.d.).</para>

<para id="para-00009">One of the oldest U.S. government agencies is the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">FDA</term> which has been the driving force behind labeling. Earlier versions of food labels focused solely on listing accurate ingredients. In recent years, labels have evolved to provide more detailed nutritional information to consumers. The FDA recently updated the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">Nutrition Facts label</term> on packaged food and drinks to incorporate current research and public input (<link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00004"/>). The changes were designed to make it easier for consumers to make good food choices to improve health and wellness. In addition to the new changes, the FDA also engaged in a campaign to strategically support consumer education to decrease poor nutrition that contributes to disease and death.</para>

<section id="sect-00005">
<title>Consumer Health Information</title>
<para id="para-00015">The trend toward consumer awareness and personal responsibility has dramatically affected how food and nutrition are currently promoted. Nurses can use the wealth of available resources to promote a healthy relationship with food for individuals, families, and populations.</para>
<para id="para-00016"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">Consumer health information</term> is widely available through the Internet and other media sources (television, podcasts, magazines, etc.). When using consumer health resources, first assess the scientific validity of the information (North Dakota State University, 2019). For all media sources, the author or speaker should be qualified to write or speak on the topic, and the research sources supporting the material should be clearly identified. Online information should come from a reputable website. Government websites (ending in.gov), educational organization websites (ending in.edu), and nonprofit agencies (ending in.org) are considered the most reliable sources of online information.</para>
<para id="para-00017">The nurse should instruct clients to review nutritional information with a questioning attitude. Clients should be wary of nutritional information that includes any of the following:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00003">
<item>Strategies that sound too good to be true</item>
<item>Nutritional recommendations that are too simplistic or dramatic, and unlikely to be supported by scientific evidence</item>
<item>Identifying specific foods as “good” or “bad”</item>
<item>Nutritional guidance that is promoted by nonscience-based testimonials or celebrities or that has supporting research “underway”</item>
<item>Guidance not supported by more than one study and not recommended by reputable scientific organizations North Dakota State University (2019).</item>
</list>
<para id="para-00018">Of course, even the most accurate information may not be appropriate for a particular client. The nurse should use clinical judgment to determine whether the nutritional information applies to the client’s situation. Additionally, the nurse should consider the client’s literacy level and the ability to understand what is being explained.</para>
<section id="sect-00006">
<title>Health Literacy</title>
<para id="para-00019">An essential factor in the effectiveness of labeling or any health education is the ability of the client to read and understand the information. <term id="term-00007">Health literacy</term> is the ability to &#8220;obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions&#8221; (USHHS, ODPHP, 2021). In 2010, the USHHS released a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00038">National Action Plan to Improve Health Literacy</term>. Fundamental to this plan is the belief that all people have the right to make informed decisions and that health services should be delivered in ways that support this right. Services should be provided in ways that are easy to understand and that promote healthy living (USHHS, ODPHP, 2021). Accordingly, limited health literacy is linked to poor health outcomes (USHHS, ODPHP, 2021).</para>
<note class="clinical-tip" id="note-00004">
<title>Improve Communication with Health Professionals</title>
<para id="para-00020">Helping clients communicate with the health care professionals they work with will improve their care and health-related outcomes. Encourage clients to use these strategies to promote good <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00039">communication</term>:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00004">
<item>Recommend the client write down or record information during their visit.</item>
<item>Encourage the client to ask questions if something is not clear. Have the client confirm who to call if questions arise later.</item>
<item>Advise the client to let the health care team know if the client does not understand what is being said. If the information is confusing or complicated, ask for materials written in plain language that does not include medical terminology.</item>
<item>Suggest that someone accompanies the client to their next appointment (if appropriate). This person can help take notes and ask questions. If the client does not speak the same language as the health care provider, an interpreter credentialed for health care services is needed. Family members should not be expected to act as medical interpreters. (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 2010)</item>

<section id="sect-00007">
<title>Client Readiness to Learn and Client Teaching Strategies</title>
<para id="para-00021">Nurses should ensure clients have the skills and knowledge they need to participate effectively in their health care (Hendler, 2022). However, attempting to teach clients when they are not interested in learning is challenging. Accordingly, the nurse’s overall client assessment involves determining the client’s <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00034">readiness to learn</term>. The following questions can help the nurse identify cues relevant to learning readiness:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00005">
<item>Does the client express an interest in the subject?</item> 
<item>Does the client ask relevant questions?</item>
<item>Is the client’s body language consistent with someone who is paying attention?</item>
<item>Does the client appear distracted and disinterested?</item>
</list>
<para id="para-00022">To try to increase the client’s interest in learning, the nurse should take time to establish rapport. The nurse should ask the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">client questions</term> to learn more about the client’s preferences and needs and explain the benefits of learning the material.</para>
<para id="para-00023">Assessing <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00040">readiness to learn</term> is part of a more extensive assessment that should occur when preparing to teach clients. Hendler (2022) summarizes an approach to effective teaching:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00006">
<item>Assess the client’s learning style.</item>
<item>Determine the client’s strengths and weaknesses.</item>
<item>Identify the client’s learning needs.</item>
<item>Identify any relevant cultural or religious considerations.</item>
</list>
<para id="para-00024">During the teaching session the nurse should do the following:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00007">
<item>Use appropriate resources for the client’s situation and literacy level. Obtain an interpreter who is credentialed in medical interpretation if needed.</item>
<item>Involve family or close friends in the session when possible since they are involved in the client’s health care and daily living.</item>
<item>Communicate using plain language that minimizes the use of medical jargon.</item>
<item>If possible, teach the content over multiple sessions.</item>
</list>
</section>
<section id="sect-00008">
<title>Evaluation of Effectiveness of Client Teaching</title>
<para id="para-00025">The nurse should evaluate <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">client teaching</term> to determine if the client has understand the information and applied it to their life. Most frequently, client teaching is evaluated using feedback from the client. This can be verbal feedback. For example, can the client answer relevant questions correctly? The nurse could have the client explain in their own words what the nurse has said; the nurse could also demonstrate the material taught, if applicable. If possible, the nurse should check in with the client later to monitor progress and answer any additional questions. Also, the nurse should monitor any relevant client outcomes. For example, have blood glucose levels or hemoglobin A1C levels improved after instructing a client with newly diagnosed diabetes on diet management of the condition?</para>
</section>
</section>
<section id="sect-00009">
<title>Holistic Assessment of Cultural Considerations</title>
<para id="para-00026">A client’s culture is intertwined with their health, requiring providers to continually learn more about their values, beliefs, and ways of life (Gbareen, Barnoy &amp; Theilla, 2021). A <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">cultural assessment</term> involves more than identifying any language barriers. The nurse should seek to understand the client’s perspective, preferences, or social norms that are part of the client’s life and affect the client’s food preparation and consumption.</para>
