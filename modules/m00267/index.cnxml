<para id="para-00002"><term id="term-00001">Psychosis</term> is a collection of symptoms that include some level of disconnection with reality. These symptoms can include hallucinations, paranoid thoughts, and illogical thinking. Psychosis can be a symptom of a mental illness—most commonly schizophrenia. It can also be a symptom of bipolar disorder or severe depression. Psychotic disorders are generally known to have a strong genetic component. The onset of psychotic symptoms can begin either gradually or quickly. Initial symptoms are commonly seen during adolescence or young adulthood (National Institute of Mental Health [NIMH], 2023c). Psychosis can also develop later in life with neurological conditions such as dementia or be caused by sleep deprivation, certain medications, or alcohol/substance use.</para>
<para id="para-00003">Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder characterized by disorganized thought processes, blunted or inappropriate emotional responses, and bizarre behavior. In addition, it may involve social withdrawal (<term id="term-00002">asociality</term>) by the affected person. Eventually individuals begin to deteriorate and demonstrate a lack of self-care and interpersonal skills. Symptoms of schizophrenia are classified as either positive, referring to an excess of distortion of normal function (e.g., hallucinations), or negative, meaning diminishing or absent behaviors related to motivation or expression (Correll &amp; Schooler, 2020). Schizophrenia is diagnosed with at least two of the following symptoms present (American Psychiatric Association, 2022). At least one of the symptoms must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. Other possible symptoms include disorganized or catatonic behavior (<term id="term-00003">catatonia</term>) or negative symptoms (diminished emotional expression or <term id="term-00004">avolition</term>). Research suggests that clients with schizophrenia have abnormal neurotransmission systems—primarily the dopaminergic, serotonergic, and glutamatergic systems. It is believed that positive symptoms are associated with overactivity of dopamine<sub>2</sub> (D<sub>2</sub>) receptors in the basal ganglia, hypothalamus, limbic system, brainstem, and medulla. It is theorized underactive dopamine<sub>1</sub> (D<sub>1</sub>) receptors in the prefrontal cortex account for the negative symptoms.</para>

<title>Schizophrenia in Children</title>

<item><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">Schizophrenia in children</term> often presents with more intense clinical manifestations and has a more chronic course.</item>
<item>The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry</term> has established current practice guidelines that advocate for high-quality assessment of the child who is receiving <term id="term-00007" class="no-emphasis">antipsychotic</term>s. The purpose of the guidelines is to promote the appropriate use of antipsychotics and to enhance safety. Today, multiple antipsychotics have specific dosing for <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">children and adolescents</term>. These <link url="https://openstax.org/r/aacap">parents’ medication guides</link> may be helpful for client education.</item>

<para id="para-00004">This section of the chapter will focus on treating psychosis. Historically, first-generation or “typical” antipsychotic agents were more effective in managing the positive symptoms versus the negative symptoms; however, the newer second-generation “atypical” medications have shown effectiveness in treating both the positive and negative symptoms. Antipsychotics are targeted at thought processes rather than affective states. Although they are not a cure, they can help both adult and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">pediatric clients</term> be able to adequately function in a healthier manner. In acute psychosis, the goal is to reduce symptoms in the first week and normalize clients’ eating and sleeping patterns. Subsequent goals are to increase the ability for self-care and increase socialization. Most of these drugs take 1–2 months to reach full therapeutic effects. With adequate drug treatment, clients can engage in individual or group psychotherapy sessions as well as return to their level of functioning prior to the illness.</para>

<title>Antipsychotics</title>
<para id="para-00007">First-generation antipsychotics are frequently referred to as “neuroleptics” because of the increased risk of producing extrapyramidal neurologic effects, including <term id="term-00011">pseudoparkinsonism</term>, <term id="term-00012">dystonia</term> (spasms of the tongue, back, legs, and neck), <term id="term-00013">akathisia</term> (not being able to sit still), and <term id="term-00014">tardive dyskinesia</term> (abnormal muscle movements). Health care providers should monitor clients for extrapyramidal effects so they can be treated and the antipsychotic medication can be changed (Ameer &amp; Saadabadi, 2023).</para>
</note>
<para id="para-00008">Antipsychotics fit into the classification of dopamine receptor antagonists (blockers). They are used to treat disorders that involve thought processes. They help clients with organizing their thoughts and responding appropriately to stimuli. The therapeutic effects are most likely due to blocking dopamine receptors. Unfortunately, these medications can also bind to a variety of receptors, which leads to many of the ADRs. Antipsychotics are categorized in two main classes: first-generation agents, also known as typical or conventional, and second-generation agents, also known as atypical. These categories are based on their mechanism of action (described in the following sections). Although their names may imply that psychosis is the only condition these drugs are used for, there are numerous psychiatric disorders for which these drugs can be useful.</para>
<para id="para-00009">Clients should be made aware they will usually need to remain on these drugs for years, if not for life, because there is a high rate of relapse when drug therapy is stopped. Most antipsychotics come in an oral form. Those clients who are unable or unwilling to take daily doses may receive periodic injections of a long-acting form (LAIs). The benefit of the LAIs is that they allow prescribers to tailor pharmacotherapy to each client’s needs. The LAIs are administered via <term id="term-00015">depot injections</term>. This refers to the way the drug is deposited and stored in the muscle before being absorbed. Because the drug takes a longer time to move out of the muscle and into the bloodstream, its action is prolonged.</para>

<title>First-Generation (Typical) Antipsychotics</title>
<para id="para-00010"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">First-generation antipsychotics</term> are classified by their potency (strength). The level of potency (low, medium, or high) refers to the concentration of the drug needed to produce a given response. Keep in mind that this is different from efficacy. All first-generation agents have the same ability to relieve symptoms of psychosis (efficacy). In addition to blocking dopamine receptors, they also block muscarinic, histaminergic, and alpha-adrenergic receptors, leading to numerous adverse effects (discussed later in this chapter). The three most common first-generation antipsychotics are:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00003">
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Chlorpromazine:</emphasis> This is a low-potency agent and a phenothiazine. It is also used to decrease preoperative restlessness and apprehension, treat intermittent porphyria, as an adjunct in the treatment of tetanus, and to help control nausea, vomiting, and intractable hiccups.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Fluphenazine:</emphasis> This is a high-potency agent and a phenothiazine. Compared to other antipsychotics, this drug has a low potential for causing anticholinergic effects. It is available in oral and intramuscular forms.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Haloperidol:</emphasis> This is a high-potency nonphenothiazine. It is frequently used to treat acute psychiatric situations when it is given intramuscularly.

<title>Adverse Effects and Contraindications</title>
<para id="para-00012">Most of the ADRs are related to these drugs’ anticholinergic properties, including blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, urine retention, nasal congestion, and photophobia. Arrhythmias can be caused by the dopamine-blocking effects or prolongation of the QTc interval, which could lead to fatal arrhythmias. Prolactin levels will increase, causing gynecomastia and changes in libido. First-generation antipsychotics are known to cause <term id="term-00024">extrapyramidal symptoms</term> (EPS), which are involuntary, uncontrollable movements. These include pseudoparkinsonism (muscle tremors, cogwheel rigidity, stiff facial muscles, drooling due to difficulty swallowing, shuffling gait, and slow movements), dystonia, akathisia, and tardive dyskinesia. Extrapyramidal symptoms may be more problematic with depot injections.</para>
<para id="para-00013">Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a rare but potentially fatal condition that can develop with antipsychotic use. The clinical manifestations include a sudden high-grade fever, fluctuations in blood pressure, dysrhythmias, extreme muscle rigidity, and significant tachycardia. Immediate supportive management must be instituted if this develops, which might include cooling blankets/fluids and administering antipyretics (drugs to reduce fever), antiarrhythmics, and dantrolene to treat muscle rigidity.</para>
<para id="para-00014">The manifestations of Parkinson's disease can be exacerbated by antipsychotics due to their effect on dopamine receptors. This can happen with any antipsychotic that causes EPS. In addition, these drugs can cause urinary retention and constipation. Individuals who have a mechanical or neurological obstruction of the renal or GI system should avoid these drugs, including those with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).</para>
<para id="para-00015">Due to their anticholinergic properties, these drugs can increase intraocular pressure, worsening glaucoma and possibly causing vision loss. Furthermore, those with a seizure disorder may need an increase in their antiseizure medications because the antipsychotics tend to lower the seizure threshold.</para>
<para id="para-00016">Alcohol intake and taking medications that cause CNS depression will amplify the depressant effect.</para>

<title>Second-Generation (Atypical) Antipsychotics</title>
<para id="para-00020">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00032">second-generation antipsychotics</term>, also known as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00033">atypical antipsychotics</term>, are the drugs of choice. This is especially true for clients who are newly diagnosed. The atypical antipsychotics block both dopamine and serotonin receptors. This class of antipsychotics has a broader range of action than the first-generation agents because of their effects on the serotonergic, noradrenergic, and dopaminergic systems. They seem to be more effective in relieving some symptoms and usually produce milder adverse effects (Ameer &amp; Sadabadi, 2023). The following are the most common second-generation antipsychotics:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00004">
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Aripiprazole:</emphasis> This is the first of a new class of atypical antipsychotic medications called the <emphasis effect="italics">dopamine system stabilizers</emphasis>. This class is sometimes referred to as a third-generation antipsychotic. In its oral form, aripiprazole can be used in the management of schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, irritability related to autism spectrum disorder, and Tourette syndrome. In its injectable, immediate-release form, it is used to treat agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar mania. This drug does not prolong the QTc interval; however, the FDA has issued a safety alert, confirming that compulsive or uncontrollable urges to gamble, binge eat, shop, and have sex with multiple partners have been reported.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Cariprazine:</emphasis> Used to treat schizophrenia or mania and depression related to bipolar disorder. It is also used to treat MDD.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Clozapine:</emphasis> This medication was one of the first atypical antipsychotic medications used to treat schizophrenia, but because of its side effects, is only used when other treatments have failed. Clozapine is available only through to the FDA’s Approved Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) program to ensure monitoring of WBC count and absolute neutrophil count.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Lurasidone:</emphasis> Used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar depression in clients age 13 and older. Administering this drug with food can greatly increase its absorption. This drug does not prolong the QTc interval, cause orthostatic hypotension, or have any cholinergic effects.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Olanzapine:</emphasis> In addition to treating schizophrenia, this drug is used for manic or mixed episodes of bipolar disorder and can be given parenterally to treat acute agitation.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Paliperidone:</emphasis> Used in clients age 12 and over to treat schizoaffective disorders. This is a major active metabolite of risperidone; therefore, it has the same therapeutic and adverse effect profiles. Paliperidone is available in three forms: one short-acting oral and two long-acting injectables (one administered monthly and the other every 3 months).</item>
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Quetiapine:</emphasis> Used to treat schizophrenia and depressive disorder as well as for short-term treatment of acute manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder. The extended-release form is for use only in adults.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Risperidone:</emphasis> Used to treat schizophrenia and acute bipolar mania. It is also frequently used to manage irritability and aggression associated with autism spectrum disorder in children and adolescents.

<title>Adverse Effects and Contraindications</title>
<para id="para-00022">For second-generation antipsychotics, the risk of seizures is higher as the drug dose increases. Hematologic effects include agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and fatal agranulocytosis. Clozapine is subject to additional monitoring through the FDA’s REMS program to decrease the risk of severe neutropenia. Metabolic effects are more common with these medications and include hyperglycemia and weight gain. Concerning ADRs for quetiapine include increased systolic and diastolic readings, decreased high-density cholesterol, and increased total cholesterol, low-density cholesterol, and triglycerides.</para>
<para id="para-00023">Drugs with anticholinergic properties will potentiate these effects of clozapine. Alcohol can increase the sedative effect. Cimetidine and caffeine can increase the risk of toxicity for clozapine.</para>

<title>Nursing Implications</title>
<para id="para-00027">The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking antipsychotics:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00006">
<item>Watch carefully for developmental progress in children.</item>
<item>Monitor for symptoms of schizophrenia.</item>
<item>Obtain baseline physical assessment and relevant tests including an electrocardiogram, CBC, electrolytes, liver and renal function tests, lipid panel, blood glucose levels, and thyroid function. Continue to monitor these on an ongoing basis to identify potential adverse effects.</item>
<item>Obtain baseline vital signs and urinary output.</item>
<item>Monitor weight for weight gain, agitation, and/or sleep disturbances.</item>
<item>Evaluate for the potential effects of hyperprolactinemia (high levels of the hormone prolactin in the blood).</item>
<item>Assess for any anticholinergic effects. Promote comfort measures if necessary, such as laxatives or catheterization.</item>
<item>Measure the PR and QTc interval at baseline and during the use of thioridazine or ziprasidone.</item>
<item>Obtain a detailed history for any cardiovascular conditions, glaucoma, diabetes, obstructions, seizure disorder, pregnancy (or thinking about getting pregnant), and breastfeeding.</item>
<item>Ensure the client is not a danger to themselves or others.</item>
<item>Auscultate bowel sounds every 4 hours if client is an inpatient. The constipation caused by clozapine is significant and can progress to intestinal ischemia and necrotizing colitis.</item>
<item>To prevent any unnecessary stress, explain gynecomastia and the reason it occurs.</item>
<item>Assess CNS alertness and orientation and provide safety precautions when necessary.</item>
<item>Assess for any extrapyramidal effects and provide safety measures.</item>
<item>Ensure client receives an annual eye exam to monitor for glaucoma or worsening of glaucoma.</item>
<item>Care for the client in a holistic manner, such as proper nutrition, adequate hygiene, activity level, and social interactions.</item>
<item>With acute psychotic episodes, observe for decreased agitation, combativeness, and psychomotor activity to evaluate therapeutic effectiveness.</item>
<item>Observe for decreased psychotic behaviors, such as decreased hallucinations and delusions.</item>
<item>Ensure clozapine does not get stopped abruptly because it will cause acute psychosis. This drug should be tapered over a 2-week period.</item>
<item>For clients taking clozapine, perform a thorough assessment of their cardiovascular and cardiopulmonary status.</item>
<item>Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client teaching guidelines.</item>
