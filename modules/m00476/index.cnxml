<title>Hormonal Drugs</title>
<para id="para-00002">Hormonal drugs are derived from natural sources or manufactured to mimic the body’s hormones. Hormonal drugs can be used for numerous conditions from contraception to menopause. They can replace the body’s normal hormones when insufficient amounts are produced. They can also simulate or produce a state that is desired for a specific reason. Contraception is an example in which hormonal drugs are used to create an environment that is not conducive to fertilization and implantation of an egg in the uterus.</para>
<section id="sect-00004">
<title>Estrogens</title>
<para id="para-00003">Estrogen is produced in the body in four types: estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), and estetrol (E4) (Hariri &amp; Rehman, 2023). Indications for the use of estrogen include <term id="term-00001">hormone replacement therapy (HRT)</term> during menopause to relieve signs and symptoms such as vaginal dryness, hot flashes, mood swings, and painful intercourse. One type of estrogen, <term id="term-00002">estradiol</term>, can also be used as HRT for hypogonadism and ovarian failure (medical or physiological). Estradiol is available in a multitude of types and combinations, and dosages vary with the indication and use, the administration method, and its combined form (DailyMed, <emphasis effect="italics">Estradiol</emphasis>, 2021; Hariri &amp; Rahman, 2023).</para>
<para id="para-00004"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">Estrogens</term> are administered in several ways. If administered orally, they are absorbed well from the gastrointestinal tract, metabolized by the liver, and excreted in urine. Depending on the dose, estrogens can inhibit or promote ovulation. Other positive effects include preservation of calcium and phosphorus and stimulation of bone growth.</para>

<title>Adverse Effects and Contraindications</title>
<para id="para-00006">Adverse effects of estrogens are related mostly to the retention of fluids. Migraine headaches, bloating, weight gain, mood depression, stroke, and cardiovascular disease are known adverse reactions and can be life-threatening.</para>
<para id="para-00007">Contraindications for estrogens include hormone-positive breast cancer, undiagnosed uterine bleeding, and active or history of thrombophlebitis or thromboembolism. Pregnancy and breastfeeding are also contraindications because estrogens cross the placenta and enter breast milk. Estrogens must be used cautiously in conditions that are affected or exacerbated by fluid retention, such as migraine headaches with an aura, renal or cardiac dysfunction, and hypertension. Obesity and age greater than 35 are circumstances when estrogens should be used cautiously, if at all.</para>

<title>Progestins</title>
<para id="para-00013"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">Progestins</term> include progesterone and its derivatives. They can function as both a stimulant and an inhibitor to manage the secretion of pituitary gonadotropins. One of the properties of progestins is their ability to prevent follicular maturation and ovulation. They accomplish this by inhibiting the secretion of pituitary gonadotropins and decreasing LH secretion. Progestins thicken cervical mucus, which hinders sperm migration and changes the endometrium to decrease the likelihood that an egg can be implanted. These properties make progestins an excellent contraceptive medication. Progestins are metabolized by the liver and excreted in urine.</para>
<para id="para-00014">Progesterone is used for several reasons. It can be added to estrogen in postmenopausal HRT to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. It is also used for amenorrhea and for dysfunctional uterine bleeding. It can be administered orally, intramuscularly, intrauterine, and as a gel, depending on the intended effect of the drug. Progesterone dosage for HRT varies, as does the number of days it is used per month.</para>
<para id="para-00015">Desogestrel, drospirenone, medroxyprogesterone, norethindrone, and levonorgestrel are progestins. Desogestrel and drospirenone are used only in combination form for contraception.</para>

<title>Contraceptives</title>
<para id="para-00023"><term id="term-00023">Contraceptives</term> are a group of medications, generally natural or synthetic hormone preparations, used to prevent pregnancy. Hormonal contraceptive medications work at distinct stages within the female (ovarian) reproductive system and use a variety of methods to interrupt the normal cycle of hormone release, egg fertilization, and/or implantation. Hormonal contraceptives can be oral, topical, vaginal, injectable, or implantable.</para>
<para id="para-00024">One important fact concerning all contraceptives, except male and female condoms, is that they do not prevent <term id="term-00024">sexually transmitted infections (STIs)</term>. Therefore, client education about this topic is crucial. Another major consideration about contraceptives is that none of them is 100% effective in preventing pregnancy. There is a risk that sexual intercourse, even with the use of contraceptives, can lead to pregnancy (Britton et al., 2020).</para>
<para id="para-00025">Synthetic forms of estrogen and progestin are the hormones used in contraceptive drugs. These drugs contain either an estrogen-progestin combination or progestin alone. Estrogen works by the negative feedback loop to decrease the secretion of LH and FSH from the anterior pituitary gland. With lower levels of LH and FSH, a dominant follicle will not develop, and a mature egg will not be released from the follicle (Britton et al., 2020; Casey, 2022; Cooper et al., 2020).</para>
<para id="para-00026">Progestin thickens the cervical mucous and prevents sperm from reaching the egg. It also changes the endometrium so that the environment of the uterus is less favorable for egg implantation. Refer to the previous section regarding hormones for specific information about estrogen and progestin.</para>
<para id="para-00027">The combination oral contraceptives (COC) and progestin-only contraceptives (POP) make up two types of oral contraceptive pills. The third type is a continuous or extended-use pill, which means the pills are taken without any pause for an indefinite time. This contraceptive regimen allows for increased ovulation suppression and medication adherence, is more satisfactory for the user, and decreases both scheduled and breakthrough bleeding over time (Britton et al., 2020; Casey, 2022; Cooper et al., 2020).</para>
<note class="clinical-tip" id="note-00004">
<para id="para-00028"><emphasis effect="bold">Dealing with Side Effects of Birth Control Methods</emphasis></para>
<para id="para-00029">The most frequent side effects of all birth control methods are nausea and breakthrough bleeding. Instructing the client to take the medication before going to bed is one of the best ways to manage nausea so that the client is asleep when the worst of the nausea occurs. Eating small meals frequently, avoiding spicy and greasy foods, and drinking ginger ale or clear liquids are other ways to alleviate nausea. The nausea should go away after about 3 months.</para>
<para id="para-00030">Breakthrough bleeding can be frustrating to the client. However, this should also subside after 3 months. Some clients may have only spotting and some may have times of heavy bleeding other than their period (if contraceptive method allows for monthly cycle to continue).</para>
<para id="para-00031">There is no way to determine which client will have which side effects. Every individual’s experience is different. The body is adjusting to new levels of hormones, and this process takes about 3 months. Emotional support to the client is also important. Some clients may need to try more than one contraceptive pill or method to find the best fit for their situation.</para>

<title>Oral and Injectable Contraceptives</title>
<para id="para-00032">Oral contraceptives are pills that contain either a combination of estrogen and progestin or progestin alone. Oral contraceptives are prescribed based on a client’s medical history, needs, and risk factors. <term id="term-00025">Combined oral contraceptives (COCs)</term> contain estrogen and progestin in varying dosages. The type of progestin varies with each COC depending on the individual client’s needs and medical status. There are three different categories of COCs. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00026"><emphasis effect="italics">Monophasic</emphasis> contraceptive pills</term> contain a fixed ratio of estrogen and progestin. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00027"><emphasis effect="italics">Biphasic</emphasis> COCs</term> contain a fixed dose of estrogen with a varying dose of progestin. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028"><emphasis effect="italics">Triphasic</emphasis> COCs</term> contain low doses of both estrogen and progestin with a varying dose of estrogen (Britton et al., 2020; Casey, 2022; Mayo Clinic, 2023a; Cooper et al., 2020).</para>
<para id="para-00033">Injectable contraceptives are hormones that are injected, usually intramuscularly, at specific intervals to provide the same birth control protection as oral contraceptives (Britton et al., 2020; Casey, 2022; Cooper et al., 2020).</para>

<title>Intrauterine and Implanted Contraceptives</title>
<para id="para-00038">In addition to oral and injectable contraceptives, <term id="term-00046">intrauterine devices (IUDs)</term> and <term id="term-00047">implanted contraceptive devices</term> are available. The advantages to these forms of contraception are their long-term effects and ease of use. They do not require remembering to take daily pills or scheduling appointments for injections. However, they do have side effects, like any hormonal medication. Additionally, because they are inserted into the body, risks of infection and migration (moving) or dislodgement of the devices exist (Andersen &amp; Spanfeller, 2022; Britton et al., 2020; Casey, 2022; Madden, 2023).</para>
<para id="para-00039">IUDs have become the most commonly used contraceptive method in the world and are among the most effective types of contraceptives. IUDs are small T-shaped devices that are placed inside the uterus via the cervix. Five types of IUDs are used in the United States. Four of them are hormonal. They release small amounts of progestin (levonorgestrel) into the body. They also have a positive effect of making monthly periods lighter. Further, these IUDs may decrease the risk of ovarian, endometrial, and cervical cancers (Andersen &amp; Spanfeller, 2022; Casey, 2022; Madden, 2023).</para>
<para id="para-00040">The fifth type is copper. It works by stimulating the body’s immune response, creating an unfavorable uterine environment for the sperm, and preventing pregnancy. It may initially increase bleeding with periods and between periods; however, the bleeding should lessen to an acceptable level. Hormonal IUDs can last for 3–8 years, depending on the specific hormone and dose, and the copper type lasts for 10 years (Andersen &amp; Spanfeller, 2022; Britton et al., 2020; Casey, 2022; Madden, 2023).</para>
<para id="para-00041">Another type of birth control method is the implanted device. The device comes as a single soft, radiopaque, flexible implant (4 cm in length × 2 mm in diameter) that contains 68 mg etonogestrel, 15 mg barium sulfate, and 0.1 mg magnesium stearate. It comes with the insertion device in the package. The contraceptive is implanted under the skin of the inner upper arm. It has the same action, use, contraindications, and side effects as any other contraceptive containing levonorgestrel. The primary risk is infection or dislodgement of the implant. This device lasts for 3 years and is a highly effective contraceptive method (Britton et al., 2020; Casey, 2022; DailyMed, <emphasis effect="italics">Nexplanon</emphasis>, 2022).</para>

<title>Adverse Effects and Contraindications</title>
<para id="para-00043">Contraindications include active STI or recent pelvic infection, pregnancy, cancer of the cervix or uterus, or unexplained vaginal bleeding. Hormonal IUDs should not be used by clients who have had breast cancer.</para>
<para id="para-00044">Side effects include bleeding and spotting as the uterus adjusts to the IUD. Other adverse effects include abdominal pain, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and expulsion of the IUD. Extremely rare is the possibility that an IUD may cause uterine perforation.</para>
<para id="para-00045">For a copper IUD, the bleeding and spotting may last up to 6 months. The insertion of the IUD may be uncomfortable, and the client may experience some cramping and backache for a day or two after the procedure. The pain can be managed using ibuprofen or acetaminophen and heating pads. Other side effects include nausea, cramping, ovarian cysts, and mood changes. The most concerning complications of all IUDs are infection, expulsion, or perforation; however, the risk for these complications is extremely low (Andersen &amp; Spanfeller, 2022; Britton et al., 2020; Casey, 2022; Madden, 2023).</para>

<title>Other Contraceptive Methods</title>
<para id="para-00046">Two other hormonal contraceptive methods are a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00053">transdermal patch</term> and a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00054">vaginal ring</term>. The patch contains an estrogen–progestin combination and is applied weekly for 3 weeks and left off for 1 week. The vaginal ring also contains a combination of estrogen–progestin and is inserted once and left in place for 3 weeks. The ring is removed for 1 week before a new ring is inserted. Both methods are based on a 4-week cycle (Britton et al., 2020; Casey, 2022).</para>
<para id="para-00047">In 2018 the FDA approved a new vaginal ring that is reused for a year (Center for Devices and Radiological Health, 2018). It is used according to the same cycle of 3 weeks in place and 1 week out. The difference is that between cycles it can be washed and stored and then reused.</para>
<para id="para-00048">Specific client teaching for the vaginal ring includes properly placing and removing the ring and properly disposing of the monthly ring or cleaning and storage of the yearly ring. If the ring is removed for more than 3 hours, clients should be advised to use a backup contraceptive method concurrently for 7 days (Britton et al., 2020; Casey, 2022).</para>
<para id="para-00049">Client teaching for the patch includes correct opening of the package; placing the patch on clean, dry skin on the buttocks, upper outer arm, lower abdomen, or upper body; pressing it firmly for 10 seconds; and not placing the patch on the breasts (Britton et al., 2020; Casey, 2022).</para>

<title>Infertility Drugs</title>
<para id="para-00061">Infertility drugs constitute a highly specialized class of drugs. The content in this chapter is intended to give the reader an introduction to the topic. Infertility can occur for numerous reasons that are beyond the scope of this chapter to detail. Some causes of infertility are related to impaired hormone secretion from the reproductive system and the thyroid. Other causes include blockages or conditions that require surgical intervention to resolve. This chapter will cover only the drugs used to promote fertility.</para>
<para id="para-00062">Some clients cannot become pregnant without exogenous treatment, meaning they will need medications administered to assist their body’s reproductive system to ovulate and for the egg to mature. Some medications directly stimulate the follicles and ovulation; others stimulate the hypothalamus to increase the secretion of FSH and LH, which then lead to follicle and ovary development and maturation.</para>
<para id="para-00063">These medications are typically used only for clients who have functioning ovaries and who have been unable to become pregnant after at least 1 year of trying. However, if a client is over age 35, fertility drugs are generally used after 6 months of trying. The other purpose of infertility drugs is for people who want multiple follicles developing in order to harvest ova for in vitro fertilization.</para>
<para id="para-00064">One important aspect of fertility treatment is the complex schedule for taking each medication and when intercourse should take place to increase the chance of egg fertilization. Additionally, provider appointments may not be easy to facilitate if the client lives a distance from the clinic or is limited by their personal situation in scheduling appointments at the clinic. Further, if the client is self-administering injections, they will need instructions and supplies.</para>
