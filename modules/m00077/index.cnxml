<title>Plan Nutritional Goals Based on Testing Results</title>
<para id="para-00002">Nutritional plans (meal plans) should be made with the client based on their specific signs and symptoms. This plan may also include nutrient intake adjustments based on absorption requirements. Nutritional plans should include any nutritional intake restrictions or additions for overall gastrointestinal health based on the client’s specific needs. In addition to the nutrients needed to avoid the deficiencies outlined in <link target-id="table-00004" document="m00076"/>, the plan should include foods known to be beneficial for the overall wellness of the gut’s normal <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">microbial growth</term> and should be based on the client’s food preferences and dietary restrictions.</para>
<para id="para-00003">A common vitamin deficiency that displays with abnormal assessment findings is vitamin B. Vitamin B deficiencies that can be found, in order of most importance to the body for normal function, include:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00002">
<item>B<sub>12</sub> (cobalamin)</item>
<item>B<sub>1</sub> (thiamine)</item>
<item>B<sub>2</sub> (riboflavin)</item>
<item>B<sub>6</sub> (pyridoxine)</item>
<item>B<sub>3</sub> (niacin)</item>
<item>B<sub>9</sub> (folate)</item>
<item>B<sub>7</sub> (biotin)</item>
</list>
<para id="para-00004">Several macro- and micronutrients can appear as abnormal assessment findings when deficient or toxic. They are listed as follows in order of importance for normal gastrointestinal function:</para>

<item>Iron</item>
<item>Zinc (deficiency and toxicity)</item>

<para id="para-00005">The client may require enzyme replacement for digestion in the absence of a functioning liver, gallbladder, or pancreas.</para>
<para id="para-00006">When the nurse is evaluating the client’s diet to ensure healthy gut microbiota, dietary additions that might be considered include fiber, additional water, yogurt with active bacterial cultures, whole grains, fruits and vegetables, foods high in antioxidants, and probiotic and prebiotic foods (Afzaal et al., 2022; Gunnars, 2023; Lee et al., 2022; Weersma et al., 2020). Substances that should be restricted include saturated fats and trans fats, sodium, and alcohol (Afzaal et al., 2022).</para>
<note class="clinical-tip" id="note-00001">
<title>Changes to a Client's Nutritional Intake</title>
<para id="para-00007">Before the dietitian or nurse makes any recommendations to add or restrict anything from the client’s nutritional intake, laboratory tests should be done to confirm what the physical assessment indicates. Once that testing is completed, the nutritional plan can be established.</para>
</note>
  <para id="para-00012">Nurses must also understand the synergistic relationships between certain nutrients so they can plan interventions to optimize nutritional progress. For example, if a client is <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">iron</term> deficient, an acidic environment will increase iron absorption, which can be achieved by adding <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">vitamin C</term> to the diet (Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, 2020a). An inability to absorb iron could be directly related to a problem in the gastrointestinal system because most of the body’s iron absorption occurs in the duodenum and proximal jejunum, so adding vitamin C to the client’s diet would be crucial to correct their deficiency (Ems et al., 2023). There are also inhibitory effects to be aware of; calcium, phytates, and polyphenols, for example, can reduce iron availability.</para>
<para id="para-00008">The inability to absorb nutrients is concerning when the client has gastrointestinal disease. Their nutritional plan will include supplementation and higher nutritional intake levels than for a healthy client. A client with a gastrointestinal disorder may eventually require injectable forms of vitamins to stay healthy if they cannot absorb them adequately through oral ingestion. To best prepare a nutritional plan with the client, the nurse must consider the client’s food preferences and cultural practices.</para>

<section id="sect-00003">
<title>Identify Challenges to Nutritional Goals</title>
<para id="para-00009">A client may face several challenges when trying to achieve their nutritional goals for gastrointestinal health. The first is <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">malabsorption</term>. Even when the client adheres to the nutritional plan of care, their body may be unable to absorb the nutrients provided in their oral intake. Many gastrointestinal diseases can cause these issues (refer to <link document="m00080">Special Nutritional Considerations for Gastrointestinal Health</link> for greater detail on gastrointestinal diseases). To address such deficiencies, the dietitian, nurse, and health care provider must work closely with the client to monitor laboratory results and add supplementation in oral, enteral (feeding tube), and parenteral forms as needed to reach nutritional goals.</para>
<para id="para-00010">Another challenge that may be encountered is the presence of food allergies or comorbidities. Many foods contain allergens, such as eggs, milk, red meat, nuts, wheat/barley/rye (gluten), shellfish, and citrus fruits. Comorbidities present a concern because if the client already has multiple nutritional restrictions due to other illnesses, such as diabetes, hypertension, or chronic kidney disease, fewer food options may be available to them. In addition, the client may be less motivated or able to follow a nutritional plan the more restrictive it becomes.</para>
<para id="para-00011">The final challenge to consider is the side effects of the gastrointestinal disease processes a client may be experiencing. When a client has a gastrointestinal disease, they may be dealing with nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and/or diarrhea. These issues may cause the client to be unable to consume food or to absorb enough nutrients from what they do consume. For a client with these issues to be successful with their nutritional goals, the health care provider, dietician, and nurse will need to address these issues, and the nutritional plan will need to include foods that do not aggravate the client’s conditions.</para>
