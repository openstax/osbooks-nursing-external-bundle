<title>Planning Nutrition Goals</title>
<para id="para-00002">It is important to set <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">nutritional goals</term> with individuals with endocrine disorders as diet plays a crucial role in managing these conditions and promoting overall health and well-being. Research has shown that dietary modifications can significantly improve outcomes and reduce the risk for complications associated with various endocrine disorders, particularly diabetes. For example, research has shown that dietary interventions, including reducing simple carbohydrate and added sugar intake and increasing protein and fiber intake, can improve blood glucose control and reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease in individuals with type 2 diabetes (Gray &amp; Threkeld, 2019).</para>
<para id="para-00003">The American Diabetes Association (2019) has identified a framework for nutrition therapy goals that reflect the importance of using a holistic approach to working with clients with diabetes. Their broad goals of nutrition therapy are to:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00002">
<item>Promote and support healthful eating patterns emphasizing a variety of appropriately portioned nutrient-dense foods.</item>
<item>Consider personal and cultural preferences, health literacy, willingness to change, and access to healthy foods.</item>
<item>Not judge clients about their food choices so that their eating can continue to be enjoyable.</item>
<item>Provide practical tools for developing good eating practices rather than focusing too much on a particular food item or food type.</item>
</list>
<para id="para-00004">Clients with diabetes should follow the prescribed diet which typically includes a limited number of calories and carbohydrates. General guidelines for meal planning with diabetes include (CDC, 2023b):</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00003">
<item>Limiting added sugars and refined grains such as white bread, rice, and pasta</item>
<item>Including more non starchy vegetables</item>
<item>Limiting intake of highly processed foods</item>
</list>
<para id="para-00005">Setting nutritional goals for clients with endocrine disorders can be difficult. Endocrine disorders are complex conditions that can seem overwhelming to the client to manage. In addition to considering the nutritional components of the diet the nurse must consider cultural, socioeconomic, and psychological factors affecting food intake. The goal-setting process is only successful if it is collaborative. The nurse should encourage the client to explain how their family, culture, and beliefs influence how and what they eat. These influences should be incorporated into the goals set.</para>
<para id="para-00006">When setting nutritional goals, both short-term and long-term goals are needed. Short-term goals may be necessary to help stabilize and manage acute changes in hormone levels that have occurred. Short-term goals may require more stringent meal planning and food consumption that is not realistically sustainable over time. Long-term goals are necessary to help the client manage their condition on an ongoing basis. Ideally, these goals incorporate the changes needed to stabilize the client’s endocrine health in a realistic and practical manner.

<title>Managing Hypoglycemia</title>
<para id="para-00008"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020">Hypoglycemia</term> (a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00021">blood glucose</term> level below 70 mg/dL) must be treated immediately to avoid serious complications. The 15-15 Rule can be used to treat mild hypoglycemia which occurs when blood glucose levels decrease to 55-69 mg/dL. Clients with blood glucose levels in this range should consume 15 grams of carbohydrates and then recheck their blood glucose level after 15 minutes. Repeat these steps until their blood glucose is > 70 mg/dL. Examples of food items that have approximately 15 grams of carbohydrates include:</para>

<title>Identifying Challenges to Nutritional Goals</title>
<para id="para-00010">Developing and maintaining healthy eating practices can be difficult for any client. For the general population a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00022">healthy diet</term> involves eating nutrient-dense foods across all food groups while staying within calorie limits and minimizing intake of added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium (Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services, 2020). Meeting <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00023">nutritional goals</term> can be especially challenging for individuals with endocrine disorders as these conditions often require specific dietary modifications to manage these conditions.</para>
<para id="para-00011">For example, individuals with adrenal insufficiency may struggle with electrolyte balance and carbohydrate intake. Individuals with diabetes often struggle with carbohydrate intake and blood glucose management (American Diabetes Association, 2019). Additionally, there are different types of diabetes. Although the nutritional requirements for clients with diabetes are generally the same, clients with <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">Type 1 diabetes</term> must take insulin to regulate their blood glucose levels. Clients with <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00025">Type 2 diabetes</term> can manage their blood glucose levels through diet. Similarly named, but unrelated to diabetes mellitus is <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00026">diabetes insipidus</term>. Clients with this condition may be able to decrease urine output by eating a low protein or a low salt diet, but otherwise nutrition does not cause or prevent this condition (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 2021).</para>
<para id="para-00012">Following any <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00027">dietary recommendations</term> depends on more than just understanding them. Clients must also have access and means to obtain and prepare nutritious foods. A client’s culture and norms can also affect dietary behaviors and subsequent health risks (Brown et al., 2022). The nurse should consider the client’s cultural background when recommending food choices. Asking the client about their favorite foods and foods that are typically served at family or community gatherings is one way to learn more about the client’s culture.</para>
<para id="para-00013">A recent study determined that overall diet quality has improved in the United States. However, there are still disparities among socioeconomic groups. These <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">health disparities</term> can stem from lack of access to or means to obtain healthy foods. For example, clients may live in rural or inner-city areas that have few grocery stores and instead must purchase food primarily from convenience stores or fast-food restaurants. Clients with limited incomes may have to choose lesser quality food to ensure they can purchase enough food. Accordingly, differences in diet quality may also explain differences in diabetes health-related outcomes among socioeconomic groups (Orr et al., 2019). The relationship between overnutrition and socioeconomic status is complex, as individuals from lower socioeconomic groups may also develop obesity due to limited access to fresh and nutrient-dense food and easy availability of energy-dense food.</para>
<note class="media-feature" id="note-00002">
<title>Traditional Foods Project</title>
<para id="para-00014">One example of a population-health based approach to reducing the risk for diabetes is the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029">Traditional Foods Project</term>. This was a 6-year cooperative project involving the CDC and 17 native U.S. tribal programs with the goals of supporting cultural traditions that could decrease the risk for Type 2 diabetes among American Indian and Alaska Native communities (CDC, 2022c). This project demonstrated how to incorporate culture and history into current day health interventions. Brochures with examples of the <link url="https://openstax.org/r/diabetesndwp">traditional food stories they documented can be found on their website</link>.</para>
</note>
<para id="para-00015">Clients’ lifestyles also must be considered. Inadequate physical activity, poorly managed stress, and inadequate sleep can interfere with healthy eating patterns (Kesari &amp; Noel, 2022). Skipping meals and eating late at night has been linked to hormone imbalances (Gherasim et al., 2020).</para>
<para id="para-00016">Eating disorders, mental illnesses, and unhealthy diet trends can also affect nutritional status and increase the risk for malnutrition. Alcohol and substance use are significant factors that can affect a client’s nutritional status. In addition to the physical damage caused by alcohol or substance use, the consumption of these substances can affect dietary habits. Intake of both can alter client’s appetites and potentially displace the consumption of nutrient-dense food. Frequently, over consumption of alcohol or substances is associated with disrupted, sometimes chaotic lifestyles that can further impact nutritional intake (Mahboub et al., 2021).</para>

<para id="para-00020">Meena expresses a strong desire to improve her “hormone health” through lifestyle changes, particularly focusing on nutrition. However, she is feeling a little overwhelmed. Her diet recall includes foods with a lot of added sugar and salt. She tries to cook at home whenever possible to save money. When cooking at home she uses kosher or sea salt because she believes these types of salts “are healthier.” Her favorite dishes to prepare are Indian dishes she enjoyed with her family growing up. She is concerned she will no longer be able to enjoy these foods.</para>

<title>Incorporating Cultural Foods into a Diabetes Diet</title>
<para id="para-00023">Clients with diabetes may still be able to incorporate some of their favorite culture-specific foods into their diet. For example, leafy greens including collards, kale, and spinach are a traditional part of African American diets. Eating these foods can help control blood glucose levels. The Latin American staple quinoa is a good source of fiber. Lastly, legumes and lentils, commonly used in African American, Hispanic, and Latin dishes, can also help manage cholesterol and glucose levels.</para>
