    <title>Pregnancy</title>
    <para id="para-00002">Nurses must be skilled in assessing the holistic aspects of client care across the lifespan. One of the critical aspects often overlooked but of incredible value is the nutritional intake of clients. Nurses must comprehend the pulmonary system from <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">pregnancy</term> and infancy to older age, as they assess the dietary aspect and provide education and advocacy for the clients they treat.</para>
    <para id="para-00003">As clients progress through the reactions and lifestyle modifications that occur during pregnancy, considering nutrition and how it impacts the pulmonary system is yet another area of importance. Pregnancy elicits various responses from the pregnant client (Dokuhaki et al., 2021). The body undergoes various physiological changes to adapt to the introduction and adjusts to a growing fetus. The pregnant client’s nutritional needs transform to accommodate the developing fetus and consider the client’s physiological changes (Widysanto &amp; Mathew, 2022). Maternal nutritional needs and deficiencies are vital to fetal lung development and prevention of fetal and childhood complications (Arigliani et al., 2018; Baiz et al., 2019; Fandino et al., 2019; Rocha et al., 2021).</para>

    <para id="para-00004">Upper-airway changes that occur during pregnancy include <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">nasal congestion</term>, called <term id="term-00003">rhinitis</term>, because of hyperemia, edema, plasma leakage into the stroma, glandular hypersecretion, increased phagocytic activity, and increased mucopolysaccharide content. <term id="term-00004">Hyperemia</term> occurs as a result of a higher-than-normal <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">blood flow</term>. The exact etiology of rhinitis during pregnancy is unknown but is thought to be related to increased blood volume and hormonal fluctuations. Complications of rhinitis in pregnancy include <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">snoring</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">sleep-disordered breathing</term>, both related to hypertension and preeclampsia.</para>
    <para id="para-00005">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">chest wall</term> structurally adapts in pregnancy to anticipate the growing uterus and maternal weight gain as the subcostal angle of the rib cage widens between 68.5° and 103.5° and the circumference of the lower chest wall increases by 5–7 cm in girth while the diaphragm shifts upward. With pregnancy, total body <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">blood volume</term> increases 40% (Sanghavi &amp; Rutherford, 2014; Soma-Pillay et al., 2016). The rise in the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">relaxin</term> hormone initiates relaxation and loosening of ligament attachments in the lower ribs.</para>

    <title>Nutritional Needs and Deficiencies Related to Pulmonary System During Pregnancy</title>
    <para id="para-00006">Pregnant clients have additional specialized dietary needs that support the physiological changes of the client and growth of the fetus. A balance in macronutrients such as protein are vital for healthy pregnancies and babies (Herring et al., 2018). Baiz et al. (2019) recommend consuming eggs and raw or cooked vegetables to limit the effects of allergic rhinitis during pregnancy.</para>
    <para id="para-00007">Under- or overnutrition of a pregnant client causes imbalances of nutrients such as amino acids and increases blood <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">cortisol levels</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">oxidative stress</term> (Herring et al., 2018). If <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">malnutrition</term> prevails during pregnancy, the results equate to “impairment of offspring growth and development, maternal insulin resistance, cretinism, IUGR [intrauterine growth restriction], birth defects, cognitive and behavioral defects, postpartum complications, preeclampsia, eclampsia, anemia, preterm birth, maternal hemorrhaging, and additional long-term effects for both mother and offspring” (Herring et al., 2018).</para>

    <title>Maternal Nutritional Impact on the Fetus</title>
    <para id="para-00009">Adequate maternal nutrition prevents intrauterine complications such as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">intrauterine growth restriction</term> (IUGR) and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">lung development</term> in the growing fetus (Bendix et al., 2020; Fandino et al., 2019; Voraphani et al., 2022). See <link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00063"/> for the stages of lung development. IUGR results from below-average fetal development and equates to babies that are small for gestational age and have an abnormal growth trajectory; it is linked with placental dysfunction and malnutrition. The term IUGR is often interchanged with <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">small for gestational age (SGA)</term>, but the terms vary in that SGA means the fetus is small for gestational age but has an average growth trajectory. The clinical definition of IUGR is a baby weighing less than two standard deviations below the mean or remaining below the tenth percentile at a specified gestational age (Bendix et al., 2020). Infants with IUGR are at risk for complications such as asphyxia, hypothermia, hypoglycemia, and polycythemia. Long-term complications include growth limitations, neurodevelopmental handicaps, and disease processes linked to the cardiovascular, renal, and immunological systems. Even if the growth occurs in incremental units, the fetus may experience IUGR or meet poor outcomes from maternal malnutrition (Arigliani et al., 2018; Fandino et al., 2019; Rocha et al., 2021).</para>

    <para id="para-00010">If a pregnant client has inadequate nutrition, the infant with IUGR is at a higher risk for reduced nutrient availability and oxygen related to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">placental insufficiency</term>. Maternal undernutrition leads to impaired <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020">alveolarization</term> and suppressed <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00021">surfactant protein expression</term>, diminished pulmonary vascular development, lower alveolar surface area, increased <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00022">extracellular matrix</term>, and thickened <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00023">blood-gas barrier</term>, limiting compliance and capacity. Causes of IUGR include severe maternal starvation and suppressed pregnancy weight gain, high <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">altitude</term>, maternal <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00025">hypoxia</term>, diabetes, and infections such as tuberculosis. Inadequate protein intake during pregnancy leads to embryonic losses, IUGR, and reduced <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00026">postnatal growth</term>, leading to a deficiency in amino acids critical for <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00027">cellular metabolism</term> and function (Herring et al., 2018). In contrast, high protein intake during pregnancy may also cause IUGR and embryonic death related to amino acid excess and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">ammonia toxicity</term> (Herring et al., 2018). Nurses must assess and educate the pregnant client on the importance of moderate protein consumption. The recommended protein intake for the first trimester is 46g/day and increases to 71g/day during the second and final trimesters (Murphy et al., 2021).</para>

    <title>Infancy</title>
    <para id="para-00011">Infancy is a stage that begins the lifespan. It follows pregnancy and birth and is characterized by rapid growth, development, and adaptations. During <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029">infancy</term>, the baby experiences rapid weight and height gains. Generally, depending on the source, babies are considered infants from birth up to age 1. Cognitive development during infancy includes exploration, attention, memory, inquisitiveness, and communication acquisition. An infant’s milestones include holding their head up, rolling over, sitting with support, crawling, standing, and walking. Infants form bonds with their caregivers that are shared through eye contact, touch, responsive care, and body language. Infants rely on their parents or caregivers for full support.</para>
    <para id="para-00012">The pulmonary system undergoes significant adaptations to support the transition between the in-utero and outside world. The fundamental pulmonary changes include the lungs’ transition from fluid-filled to breathing outside air (Arigliani et al., 2018; Fandino et al., 2019; Rocha et al., 2021). <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00030">Surfactant production</term> increases late in pregnancy and continues through development and maturation during the first few weeks of life. The lungs can expand and stretch, allowing for growing volume capacity. The airways continue to grow and mature. Infants obtain <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00031">antibodies</term> through breastmilk in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00032">colostrum</term> (in the first few days of life) and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00033">immunoglobulin A</term> (after the first few days) to help infants fight infection and support their immune systems.</para>
    <section id="sect-00008">
    <title>Nutritional Impact During Infancy</title>
    <para id="para-00013">Nutrition is crucial in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00034">lung growth</term>, development, and repair in fetuses, preterm infants, infants, and children (Arigliani et al., 2018; Bendix et al., 2020; Fandino et al., 2019; Rocha et al., 2021). One of the primary systems to develop in a fetus is the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00035">respiratory system</term>, which begins on day 22 after conception. Although the process begins early with the trachea, lungs, bronchi, and alveoli, complete development does not occur until around age 8 (Rehman &amp; Bacha, 2022). If a child is born with IUGR or SGA, health care providers must assess nutritional aspects to determine if undernutrition or malnutrition contributes to stunted growth. Micronutrients that play a role in lung maturation include vitamins A, D, E, selenium, and omega-3 fatty acids (Arigliani et al., 2018).</para>

    <title>Childhood</title>
    <para id="para-00014"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00036">Alveolarization</term> continues from infancy through approximately 8 years of age. Even if pulmonary development and function is normal at birth, insulting exposures can cause setbacks. Some scientists have traced poor lung function from infancy through childhood to identify potential events associated with decreasing optimal pulmonary development and capacity. A child born without any difficulty in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00037">pulmonary function</term> but exposed to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00038">second-hand smoke</term> may experience <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00039">stunted growth</term> (Schultz et al., 2018). According to Schultz et al. (2018), in the same study, when individuals demonstrated limitations at age 8 in lung function, they maintained these lower levels of function even when retested at age 16. When 8-year-old children have developmental limitations and are exposed to second-hand smoke, their lung function diminishes. Maternal smoking habits throughout pregnancy also play a role in decreased lung development. Schultz et al. (2018) study results further support the view that being born prematurely increases the risk for diminished lung development and function as the child grows. These children do not recover the lost development with age. They also are at an increased risk for developing asthma, wheezing, and declination of lung function during respiratory infection season.</para>
    <section id="sect-00010">
    <title>Nutritional Impact During Childhood</title>
    <para id="para-00015">Nutrition plays a significant role in the development and function of the respiratory system throughout childhood. Adequate nutritional intake during childhood maintains a healthy growth pattern, aids lung tissue repair, and supports the immune system to prevent and treat infection (Gozzi-Silva et al., 2021). Intake of adequate amounts of macronutrient protein and micronutrients vitamins A, C, E, omega-3 fatty acids, and zinc is important for lung function. Inadequate consumption of the proper nutrients causes impaired lung function and respiratory problems. Improper nutritional intake affects the immune system, which protects the lungs from infection and inflammation. Malnutrition throughout childhood increases the risk for infection and exacerbates conditions like asthma. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00040">Childhood obesity</term> causes detrimental effects on lung capacity by reducing lung capacity, expiratory reserve, and residual volume due to excessive adipose tissue increasing the intraabdominal pressure on the diaphragm, altering full chest expansion (Ferreira et al., 2020).</para>

    <item>Increased airway resistance occurs because of functional and structural changes during adolescence.</item>

    <para id="para-00017">Overall, the physiological changes that occur during adolescence contribute to or deter from pulmonary capacity and function. Although RTI susceptibility increases and asthma can be challenging during adolescence, the pulmonary systems of most adolescents experience growth.</para>
    <para id="para-00018">Nutritional intake during adolescence is crucial as the pulmonary system grows and develops (Gozzi-Silva et al., 2021). Adequate macronutrient and micronutrient intake also aids in the immune system’s development. Protein consumption should include 0.85–1.2 g of protein per kilogram of body weight per day (Hudson et al., 2021). Solid recommended sources of protein include lean meats, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy products, beans, tofu, legumes, and nuts.</para>
    <para id="para-00019">Micronutrient intake for adolescents should focus on vitamins A, C, and E, omega-3 fatty acids, magnesium, and water (Gozzi-Silva et al., 2021; Scoditti et al., 2019). Vitamins A, C, and E are essential <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00045">antioxidants</term> that protect the lungs from <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00046">oxidative stress</term> and inflammation.

    <title>Adulthood</title>
    <para id="para-00025">Adulthood is a developmental stage after adolescence and typically lasts until later adulthood. During this period, individuals reach physical and cognitive maturity and assume adult responsibilities, such as career development, marriage, and parenthood. Fewer physiological changes occur as the state of health stabilizes, and fewer rapid developmental changes occur. The body does gradually change in function and structure during the aging process. Some of these changes occur in the pulmonary system, so it is vital for nurses to advocate for healthy lifestyle modifications and perform regular health screenings to promote optimal pulmonary health throughout <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00047">adulthood</term>.</para>
    <para id="para-00026">The physiological changes during this time include lung size and function, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00048">respiratory muscle strength</term>, respiratory diseases, immune function, and lifestyle habits (Han et al., 2019; Schultz et al., 2018; Rogers &amp; Cismowski, 2018).

As lung function and capacity decline as a client ages, the importance of healthy lifestyles and nutrient-rich dietary choices cannot be overstated. The dietary choices include antioxidant-rich foods that protect the lungs from free radical damage (discussed in the next section) and oxidative stress. Fruits and vegetables are excellent sources of antioxidant-rich foods, especially berries, citrus fruits, leafy greens, and tomatoes. Omega-3 fatty acids hold anti-inflammatory properties that reduce inflammation in the lungs. Excellent sources of omega-3 fatty acids include salmon, mackerel, sardines, flaxseeds, chia seeds, and walnuts. Lean protein is an essential macronutrient to aid in repairing lung tissue and is found in skinless chicken, fish, beans, and legumes. Avoiding harmful environmental substances, not smoking, avoiding excessive alcohol intake, and getting regular exercise promotes lung function and health.</para>

    <para id="para-00034">The nurse treating older clients must recognize the need for <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00057">antioxidant supplements</term>. The current American diet is high in processed foods and additives. These food choices increase the risk for oxidative stress in the body, depleting the antioxidant capacity. The pulmonary system’s reaction to oxidative stress includes activating the inflammatory response, which further compromises the lungs and cascades further oxidative stress. These oxidative reactions to the stressors are directly linked to chronic diseases such as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00058">asthma</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00059">chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</term> (COPD), and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00060">lung cancer</term> (Rogers &amp; Cismowski, 2018).</para>
