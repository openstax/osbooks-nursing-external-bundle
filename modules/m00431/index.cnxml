<para id="para-00002"><term id="term-00001">Lipase</term> is a digestive enzyme that enables the body to digest and systemically absorb dietary fat. <term id="term-00002">Lipase inhibitors</term> bind to gastric and pancreatic lipases in the intestine. This prevents hydrolysis of dietary triglycerides into monoglycerides and fatty acids and the absorption of dietary fat. Currently, orlistat is the only one drug approved by the FDA as a lipase inhibitor (Yip &amp; Ambizas, 2019).</para>
<section id="sect-00003">
<title>Orlistat</title>
<para id="para-00003"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">Orlistat</term> (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">Alli</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">Xenical</term>) is a nonsystemic gastric lipase inhibitor that reduces intestinal absorption of dietary fat by approximately 30%. Orlistat binds to lipases, reducing absorption of dietary fat while also demonstrating the ability to lower total cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins, fasting glucose, and insulin concentrations. Additionally, client blood pressure measurements often improve (Sahebkar et al., 2018).</para>
<para id="para-00004">Orlistat is available as an oral capsule. Alli is available over the counter, whereas Xenical is available through a prescription. Capsules are taken up to three times a day, up to 1 hour before meals containing fat. Dietary fat is not absorbed systemically and is eliminated in feces.</para>
<section id="sect-00004">
<title>Adverse Effects and Contraindications</title>
<para id="para-00005">Orlistat is not systemically absorbed, so the most common side effects are gastrointestinal: flatus, abdominal pain/discomfort, nausea, oily rectal discharge, fecal urgency, diarrhea, and fatty/oily stool. The adverse GI effects often subside within 4 weeks.</para>
<para id="para-00006">Orlistat is contraindicated in clients with hypersensitivity to the drug. It is also contraindicated in conditions such as gallbladder disease, cholestasis, malabsorption X drug syndrome, hypothyroidism, anorexia/bulimia nervosa, and organic causes of obesity. Orlistat is contraindicated in pregnant clients. It should be used cautiously with gastrointestinal diseases, nephrolithiasis, hyperoxaluria, and known dietary deficiencies of vitamins A, D, E, and K. Providers should exercise caution in older adults, lactating clients, and children under age 12.</para>

<title>Nonpharmacological Lipase Inhibitors</title>
<para id="para-00008">Nonpharmacological natural lipase inhibitors are present in various foods and supplements. Ox bile supplements have lipase inhibitor activity and are taken in much the same way as orlistat. Although <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">ox bile supplements</term> are considered safe, they may cause uncomfortable GI symptoms and deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K). Ox bile supplements have been used for centuries in Eastern medicine to support various GI symptoms.</para>
<para id="para-00009">Less-invasive <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">natural lipase inhibitors</term> include caffeine, green coffee bean extract, tea (especially green tea), panax ginseng, soybeans, apples, grapevines, yerba mate, mulberry extract, and peanuts. These food items and supplements may contain several natural lipase inhibitors such as flavonoids, lactones, and polyphenols. However, any weight-loss supplements should only be used under the guidance of a weight-management health care professional.</para>

<title>Nursing Implications</title>
<para id="para-00010">The nurse should do the following for clients who are taking orlistat:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00002">
<item>Consistently monitor the client’s weight, blood pressure, and serum lab values associated with obesity (e.g., lipids, glucose, and hepatic function tests).</item>
<item>Monitor clients with diabetes closely for hypoglycemia and/or the need for medication reduction or elimination. With weight loss, a client’s need for medications to treat diabetes may be reduced or eliminated.</item>
<item>Monitor clients with hypertension closely. With weight loss, a client’s need for medications to treat hypertension may be reduced or eliminated.</item>
<item>Monitor client’s weight every 3 months for dosage changes as needed.</item>
<item>Provide client teaching regarding the drug and when to call the health care provider. See below for client teaching guidelines.</item>

<item>Distribute daily fat intake evenly across all three meals.</item>
<item>Be educated to supplement with a multivitamin that also contains vitamins A, D, E, and K because lipase inhibitors may prevent absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. Vitamin supplements should be taken 2 hours before or after taking a lipase inhibitor.</item>
<item>If taking levothyroxine concurrently, take orlistat 4 hours before or 4 hours after levothyroxine to avoid reducing the serum availability of levothyroxine.</item>

<title>Losing Weight</title>
 <para id="para-00015">Finding a health care professional with experience in weight loss improves a person’s long-term weight-loss and management success. Different modalities work for different clients. An experienced weight-loss health care professional can develop an individualized weight-loss plan that includes a foundation of meal planning and exercise.</para>
