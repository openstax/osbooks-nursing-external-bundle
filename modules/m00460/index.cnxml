    <title>Eye Structures and Functions</title>
    <para id="para-00002">The human eye is an extension of the brain. Diseases of the brain are sometimes diagnosed by abnormalities seen in the eye. There are eye symptoms that can be benign or progress with age, such as <term id="term-00001">cataracts</term>, whereas other ocular symptoms can be red flags for neurological conditions.</para>

    <para id="para-00003">The eye consists of internal and external structures (see <link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00460"/>). <term id="term-00002">Internal ocular structures</term> include the following (Garrity, 2022b; Rehman et al, 2022):</para>
    <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00002">
    <item><emphasis effect="italics">Pupil:</emphasis> Allows light to enter the eye, sends neural signals, and begins the process of sight. The pupil is the round black opening in the middle of the iris that responds to light by constricting when light enters and dilating when light is reduced.</item>
    <item><emphasis effect="italics">Iris:</emphasis> The color of the eye surrounding the black pupil. The iris controls the size of the pupil based on the amount of light. This is an essential nursing assessment because deviations from normal size or unequal size pupils can indicate pathology.</item>
    <item><emphasis effect="italics">Sclera:</emphasis> The “whites of the eyes.” The sclera helps to maintain the eye’s shape and functions as a protective layer from injury.</item>
    <item><emphasis effect="italics">Anterior chamber:</emphasis> Located between the back of the cornea and front of the lens, this chamber contains <term id="term-00003">aqueous humor</term>, which is the tissue fluid of the eye. The fluid provides continuous nourishment to the lens and cornea because they have no capillaries of their own.</item>
    <item><emphasis effect="italics">Posterior chamber:</emphasis> An extension of the anterior chamber located between the lens and retina that contains vitreous humor. This has a gel-like consistency can thin as one ages and lead to a retinal breach (American Society of Retina Specialists, 2023).</item>
    <item><emphasis effect="italics">Macula:</emphasis> Responsible for central vision and produces the clearest visual detail.</item>
    <item><emphasis effect="italics">Fovea:</emphasis> A small depression in the macula and the area for central vision where visual acuity is the highest.</item>
    <item><emphasis effect="italics">Lens:</emphasis> A transparent structure that lies directly behind the pupil and transmits and focuses light to form images on the retina and for <term id="term-00004">accommodation</term> purposes. It is attached to the ciliary muscle.</item>
    <item><emphasis effect="italics">Optic nerve:</emphasis> The second cranial nerve; it has sensory functions and transmits electrical impulses from the retina to the brain’s visual cortex, which displays as a visual representation.</item>
    <item><emphasis effect="italics">Retina:</emphasis> The innermost nerve layer, containing microscopic photoreceptor cells to detect light. These receptors are called rods and cones. <term id="term-00005">Rods</term> are the receptors for night vison and help with peripheral vision. <term id="term-00006">Cones</term> are for daytime vision; they help with central vision and can detect color as well. There are three distinct types of cones, each sensitive to a different color: red, green, or blue.</item>
    </list>
    <para id="para-00004"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">Intraocular pressure (IOP)</term> is the fluid pressure caused by the amount of aqueous humor in the anterior chamber. A normal IOP is 10–21 mm Hg (Begum, 2023). The pressure is maintained by having the same amount of fluid come in as the amount of fluid leaving the front of the eye. Excess IOP is an important risk factor for glaucoma. Untreated elevated IOP can lead to blindness. Abnormally low IOP, known as hypotony, can lead to eye wasting.</para>
    <para id="para-00005"><term id="term-00008">External ocular structures</term> (see <link target-id="fig-00002" document="m00460"/>) include the following (Garrity, 2022a):</para>

    <item><emphasis effect="italics">Eyelids and eyelashes:</emphasis> These protect the eye, acting as barriers against foreign bodies, bright light, and small irritants, such as dust.</item>
    <item><emphasis effect="italics">Conjunctiva:</emphasis> The mucous membrane lining the eyelids. When this becomes inflamed, it is referred to as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">conjunctivitis</term>, which is caused by allergies, certain bacteria, or viruses.</item>
    <item><emphasis effect="italics">Cornea:</emphasis> An avascular tissue barrier that protects the eye and will result in blurry vision if scratched. The cornea is the main structure that bends light entering the eye to allow the eye to focus clearly on an image. Refraction errors can manifest as nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism (described further later in this section).</item>
    <item><emphasis effect="italics">Extrinsic muscles of the eye:</emphasis> There are a total of six, and they are attached to the bony orbit and to the surface of the eye. There are four rectus muscles (lateral, medial, superior, and inferior) that move the eye up and down or side to side. The two oblique muscles (superior and inferior) rotate the eyes.</item>

    <para id="para-00006">Fluid is produced by the lacrimal gland located at the upper, outer corner of the eye. This fluid flows continuously, but the amount increases due to irritation and certain emotions. Small lacrimal ducts take the fluid to the anterior surface of the eye. When a person blinks, the fluid spreads, which moistens and washes the surface of the eye. The fluid also contains an enzyme called lysozyme that can inhibit growth of bacteria on the surface of the eye.</para>
    <para id="para-00007">There are two small openings at the medial canthus, which is the corner of the eye near the nose. These take the fluid to the lacrimal sac that leads to the nasolacrimal duct. Here the fluid empties into the nasal cavity. This is the reason that noses run when a person cries. If the increase in fluid exceeds that of the drainage system, the excess fluid overflows the eyelids and becomes tears. This is known as lacrimation.</para>

    <section id="sect-00004">
    <title>Eye Disorders</title>
    <para id="para-00008">Healthy vision requires three basic components: formation of retinal images, stimulation of rods and cones, and nerve impulse conduction to the brain. Malfunction of any of these can disrupt vision. Eye disorders range from common refractive errors that can be treated with the use of eyeglasses, contact lenses, or surgery, to more serious conditions such as glaucoma, macular degeneration, and ocular inflammation and infection.</para>
    <para id="para-00009">Topical ophthalmic agents play a prominent role in managing many eye disorders. These drugs are intended for direct administration into the conjunctiva of the eye. This route limits systemic absorption, thereby decreasing the risk of adverse effects. Various eye disorders will be addressed in this section. The following section will discuss relevant drugs for specific eye conditions.</para>
    <section id="sect-00005">
    <title>Refractive Errors</title>
    <para id="para-00010">Refraction of light rays is the deflection or bending of rays as they pass through one object and into another of greater or lesser density. <term id="term-00010">Refractive errors</term> occur when the shape of the eye keeps light from focusing directly on the retina, thereby distorting how objects are seen. When looking at a distant object, the ciliary muscle is relaxed, causing the lens to have a flat shape. If looking at a near object, the ciliary muscle contracts, causing the lens to have a convex shape. The lens should be able to quickly adjust from far to near vision and vice versa. It is the only adjustable structure within the refractory system.</para>
    <para id="para-00011">Errors in refraction can be addressed with surgical and nonsurgical interventions. In some cases, a vision prescription can correct how light is refracted on the retina (National Eye Institute, 2022). There are four main refractive errors:</para>
    <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00004">
    <item><term id="term-00011">Hyperopia</term>, referred to as farsightedness, is characterized by seeing close objects out of focus; however, distant objects are clearly seen. The light refracts behind the retina to cause this distortion. This is because the eyeball is too short or the lens is too thin.</item>
    <item><term id="term-00012">Myopia</term>, referred to as nearsightedness, is characterized by seeing distant objects out of focus; however, close objects are clearly seen. The light refracts in front of the retina to cause this distortion. This is because the eyeball is too elongated or the lens is too thick.</item>
    <item><term id="term-00013">Astigmatism</term> occurs when light is focused on multiple points along the retina, rather than just a single point. This occurs when the cornea or the lens has a different shape than normal, often shaped more like a football than a baseball (Boyd, 2022a).</item>
    <item><term id="term-00014">Presbyopia</term> occurs as the eye ages and is characterized by lens thickening and loss of elasticity. This change occurs around age 45. Clients may begin to use over-the-counter reading glasses for close-up reading (National Eye Institute, 2020).</item>

    <title>Glaucoma</title>
    <para id="para-00013"><term id="term-00016">Glaucoma</term> is a group of diseases characterized by a decrease in peripheral vision due to an obstruction of aqueous humor that increases IOP, which can damage the optic nerve. This leads to diminished and/or distorted vision. Glaucoma can be an inherited condition or occur spontaneously. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">Black</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">Hispanic</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">Asian</term> clients have a higher risk for glaucoma. Also at higher risk are clients older than 40 years, those with thinner corneas, those with chronic eye inflammation, and those taking medications that are known to increase eye pressure (Boyd, 2022b).</para>
    <para id="para-00014">Multiple parameters are assessed when screening for glaucoma, including the following:</para>
    <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00005">
    <item><emphasis effect="italics">IOP:</emphasis> Average values are 10–21 mm Hg (Begum, 2023).</item>
    <item><emphasis effect="italics">Corneal thickness:</emphasis> Measured in microns with an average cornea thickness of 555 microns. Thinner corneas may result in artificially low pressure readings, potentially missing a glaucoma diagnosis. Similarly, thicker corneas may cause artificially elevated pressure readings, potentially creating a false glaucoma diagnosis (Glaucoma Research Foundation, 2022).</item>
    <item><emphasis effect="italics">Optic nerve:</emphasis> A healthy optic nerve is intact and generally does not show asymmetry or cupping (Waisberg &amp; Micieli, 2021).</item>
    </list>
    <note class="clinical-tip" id="note-00002">
    <title>Anxiety Can Affect IOP</title>
    <para id="para-00015">The nurse should be aware that a client’s <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020">anxiety</term> can artificially increase an IOP reading. It is important to acknowledge the client’s wariness about the tonometer touching the cornea, but the nurse should reassure the client that a numbing drop is used alleviate any perceived discomfort.</para>
    </note>
    <para id="para-00016">Clients are considered “glaucoma suspects” if they have risk factors for glaucoma including elevated IOP, optic nerve damage, visual field defect, or a strong family history of glaucoma (Ahmad, 2018).</para>
    <para id="para-00017">The two forms of glaucoma are <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00021">open-angle glaucoma</term> (the most common form) and closed-angle glaucoma. Open-angle glaucoma occurs when the trabecular meshwork becomes occluded and cannot drain the continuous production of aqueous humor. Often there are no early symptoms. Eventually, the client begins to lose peripheral vision (Mayo Clinic, 2022). Open-angle glaucoma typically progresses slowly with small increases in IOP over time. Treatments include ophthalmic drops as well as surgical treatments such as <term id="term-00022">trabeculectomy</term>, a glaucoma drainage implant that allows aqueous humor to drain through an artificial bleb (a surgically created hole) into the body for processing, and corneal transplant.</para>
    <para id="para-00018"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00023">Closed-angle glaucoma</term> progresses suddenly with a sudden rise in IOP. Clients can become blind with little warning. This condition is precipitated by either displacement of the iris or pupil dilation. Both cover the trabecular meshwork, preventing the exit of aqueous humor. IOP increases rapidly to dangerous levels when the angle between the cornea and iris becomes significantly narrowed. Symptoms can include sudden headache, eye pain, and/or blurred vision. Immediate treatment with an ophthalmologic specialist can limit ocular disability by widening the canal of Schlemm in a procedure known as <term id="term-00024">canaloplasty</term>.</para>

    <section id="sect-00007">
    <title>Macular Degeneration</title>
    <para id="para-00019"><term id="term-00025">Macular degeneration</term> occurs when the central portion of the retina inhibits central vision but maintains peripheral vision. Macular degeneration occurs in some clients as the macula ages. There are two types of degeneration:</para>
    <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00006">
    <item><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00026">Dry macular degeneration (DMD)</term> often has characteristic drusen, which consists of yellow lipid retinal deposits. There is no cure for DMD; however, there is some evidence that various nutritional and vitamin intakes, including vitamin C, lutein, and leafy green vegetables, can slow the progression (American Optometric Association, n. d.; Mrowicka et al., 2022).</item>
    <item><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00027">Wet macular degeneration (WMD)</term> is characterized by the growth of new subretinal blood vessels, which are often fragile and leaky. This leakage lifts the macula from its normal place, quickly causing permanent injury. There is no cure for WMD, but it can be treated with laser technology and intraocular medication injections (National Retina Institute, 2023).</item>
    </list>
    </section>
    <section id="sect-00008">
    <title>Ocular Inflammation and Infection</title>
    <para id="para-00020">Ocular inflammation and infection occur when the eye has become inflamed or infected through either illness or injury. <term id="term-00028">Conjunctivitis</term>, referred to as pink eye, occurs when the thin layer of tissue in front of the eye becomes irritated and red, often producing a sticky coating on the eyelashes. These symptoms can increase tear production, produce a sensation of a foreign body in the eye, and cause the client to rub their eyes. Conjunctivitis can be caused by a bacterial or viral infection, allergy, or irritant, such as a stray eyelash or after swimming in a chlorinated pool. Bacterial conjunctivitis is often treated with ocular antibacterials, in the form of either an ointment or a solution (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019). Complications are rare; however, they can include eye scarring or a secondary infection such as meningitis (National Health Service, 2023).</para>
    <para id="para-00021">There are numerous other infections and inflammatory conditions of the eye that occur at different ocular anatomical sites.</para>
    <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00007">
    <item><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029">Episcleritis</term> occurs between the conjunctiva and sclera and has a similar presentation to conjunctivitis (Johns Hopkins Medicine, n.d.; Schonberg &amp; Stokkermans, 2023).</item>
    <item><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00030">Keratitis</term> is characterized by corneal inflammation that can cause ulceration. Keratitis is considered a medical emergency. The client will need a timely diagnosis and treatment plan because extensive ulceration can lead to blindness. Keratitis is associated with infectious and noninfectious causes (Singh et al., 2023).</item>
    <item><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00031">Uveitis</term> is an inflammation of the middle part of the eye called the uvea. Though infection can be a factor, uveitis is largely considered autoimmune secondary to other systemic diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis and reactive arthritis (Rosenbaum, 2019). Uveitis is characterized by eye pain, eye redness, and <term id="term-00032">photophobia</term>. It is essential that the client seek timely diagnosis and treatment with ocular corticosteroids to avoid vision loss.</item>
    <item>A <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00033">chalazion</term> occurs when meibomian glands become occluded. It presents with edema and pain on the eyelid and is initially treated with warm wet compresses several times per day, but it may also require antibiotics and possible surgical intervention.</item>
    <item>A <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00034">hordeolum</term> (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00035">stye</term>) is a red, painful bump near the edge of the eyelid that looks like a pimple or boil. A stye has an infectious cause and often responds to warm wet compresses. Oral antibiotics are sometimes needed to successfully treat a hordeolum (American Academy of Ophthalmology, 2022).</item>
    <item><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00036">Orbital cellulitis</term> is an infection of the fat and muscles around the eye caused by pathogens, trauma, or spreading of infection from the sinuses. Orbital cellulitis can be serious and lead to brain abscess and vision loss. The client may present with a fever, eye pain, and a bulging eye. A dental history should also be reviewed because a dental abscess can track upward into the orbits. Treatment includes broad-spectrum antibiotics until the actual organism can be identified (Satar et al., 2021). Once the organism has been determined, appropriate antibiotics can be started.</item>
    <item>Obstruction or inflammation of the lacrimal gland or the lacrimal sac can occur. When the lacrimal gland is inflamed, this is termed <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00037">dacryoadenitis</term>. If the lacrimal sac is inflamed, this is referred to as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00038">dacryocystitis</term>. Treatment consists of warm compresses, ocular antibacterials, and oral antibiotics as needed. The Crigler massage is sometimes recommended to release material from the affected tear duct by pressing a clean index finger inward against the lacrimal sac and massaging downwards toward the nose (Hu et al., 2022).</item>
    <item><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00039">Keratoconjunctivitis sicca</term> is dryness of the conjunctiva and cornea. The dry eyes can be the result of too few tears being produced or tears that evaporate too quickly. This condition is characterized by inflammation of the ocular surface and lacrimal glands.</item>

    <definition id="def-00003"><term>astigmatism</term> <meaning>when the cornea or lens is curved more steeply in one direction, causing light to focus on multiple points of the retina</meaning></definition>
    <definition id="def-00004"><term>canaloplasty</term> <meaning>eye surgery that uses a microcatheter to cannulate Schlemm’s canal in order to restore aqueous humor outflow to lower intraocular pressure</meaning></definition>
    <definition id="def-00005"><term>cataracts</term> <meaning>cloudy areas on the lens of the eye from the breakdown of proteins that affect vision</meaning></definition>
    <definition id="def-00006"><term>cones</term> <meaning>receptors on the retina for daytime and color vision</meaning></definition>
    <definition id="def-00007"><term>conjunctivitis</term> <meaning>infection and inflammation of the conjunctiva, causing redness and irritation; also referred to as “pink eye”</meaning></definition>
    <definition id="def-00008"><term>external ocular structures</term> <meaning>structures outside the eye responsible for protecting the eye and allowing the eye to rotate and move up and down</meaning></definition>
    <definition id="def-00009"><term>glaucoma</term> <meaning>group of diseases caused by obstruction or excess production of aqueous humor, resulting in loss of peripheral vision</meaning></definition>
    <definition id="def-00010"><term>hyperopia</term> <meaning>a condition in which light refracts in the back of the retina, resulting in close objects appearing blurry and far objects being clearly seen; also known as farsightedness</meaning></definition>
    <definition id="def-00011"><term>internal ocular structures</term> <meaning>structures inside the eye responsible for light accommodation, eye color, fluid to support eye pressure homeostasis, and the optic nerve</meaning></definition>
    <definition id="def-00012"><term>macular degeneration</term> <meaning>degeneration of the central portion of the retina, causing gradual loss of central vision</meaning></definition>
    <definition id="def-00013"><term>myopia</term> <meaning>a condition in which light refracts in front of retina, resulting in far objects appearing blurry and near objects being clearly seen; also known as nearsightedness</meaning></definition>
    <definition id="def-00014"><term>photophobia</term> <meaning>abnormal sensitivity to light</meaning></definition>
    <definition id="def-00015"><term>presbyopia</term> <meaning>a condition that occurs as one ages; the lens thickens and becomes less elastic, which makes it difficult for the eyes to accommodate</meaning></definition>
    <definition id="def-00016"><term>refractive errors</term> <meaning>when light does not shine directly on the retina, causing distorted vision</meaning></definition>
    <definition id="def-00017"><term>rods</term> <meaning>receptors on the retina for nighttime vison</meaning></definition>
    <definition id="def-00018"><term>trabeculectomy</term> <meaning>eye surgery that creates a bypass of obstructed aqueous fluid in the trabecular network to prevent further loss of vision in glaucoma</meaning></definition>
