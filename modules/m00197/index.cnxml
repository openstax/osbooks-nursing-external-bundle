<para id="para-00002"><term id="term-00001">Community health education</term> is the process of providing information regarding optimal health and wellness at the community level (American Public Health Association [APHA], 2023). This process involves surveying a community to determine health issues and trends in order to find solutions. Community health educators may work with local schools, government agencies, health departments, and other community agencies to identify education needs. Health education programs include topics such as substance abuse, chronic disease prevention and treatment, nutrition, exercise, mental health, and maternal/fetal health, targeting individuals, families, groups, or communities. Community education provides accurate information to community members to better equip them to make healthier lifestyle choices. Education also improves <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">health literacy</term>, making it easier for clients to navigate the health care system. While education may not be the only factor influencing knowledge, attitude, and behavior, it is instrumental in assisting the learner in making changes toward a healthier <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">lifestyle</term>. Health education may involve disseminating foundational information and/or helping clients implement it in specific circumstances. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">Behavior change</term> is a multifactorial process for clients, with the first steps including a desire or reason to change and education on what to change and how to change. This allows clients to develop and take actionable steps to meet their needs.</para>
<para id="para-00003">Health education programs may look different depending on the community as they adapt to the needs of their learners. The overall goals of these education programs should be to protect and promote clients' health at the individual, community, and population levels. Some health education program examples are the following:</para>

<title>Importance of Community Health Education</title>
<para id="para-00004">Community health education places power in the hands of the client to make informed decisions regarding their health and well-being, leading to longer, healthier lives. Education provides methods to prevent health complications by identifying health concerns early and seeking treatment as needed. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">Prevention</term> of disease and disability leads to healthier lifestyles and reduces health care costs. Additionally, education can lead to better jobs, higher income, stress reduction, and improved social and psychological skills (Virginia Commonwealth University, 2022). Education also increases awareness of health issues. <link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00197"/> demonstrates the links between education, health, and contextual factors for overall well-being.</para>
<para id="para-00005">In the long run, educational interventions should improve health outcomes and minimize long-term disability. Education improves <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">client autonomy</term> by providing skills and knowledge to make better-informed health and lifestyle decisions and allows them to assume personal responsibility for their health. For example, metabolic screenings can help clients identify early abnormal values in their lipids. This, coupled with lifestyle and dietary education in the community, can give these clients the necessary tools to enhance their diet and activity level to improve health outcomes and minimize long-term complications.</para>

<para id="para-00007">Community health nurses play a foundational role as educators. The <link url="https://openstax.org/r/publichealthgateway"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">10 Essentials of Public Health Services</term></link> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">Healthy People 2030</term> objectives clarify the community nurse's role as an educator. An essential role of public health nurses is to “communicate effectively to inform and educate people about health, factors that influence it, and how to improve it” (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2023a, para 3). Therefore, the community health nurse provides education with every intervention and across all levels of prevention. For example, education at the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">primary level of prevention</term> includes <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">health promotion</term>, such as vaccination, exercise, and diet. Education at the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">secondary level of prevention</term> includes information on <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">health screening</term> results, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">early diagnosis</term>, and early treatment of disease. Education at the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">tertiary level of prevention</term> provides ways to prevent further disability and improve lifestyle following diagnosis of a disease or disability. Nurses educate clients about specific disease states and problems and provide information about available health care services. Community health nurses also teach about behaviors to promote overall wellness and prevent illness.</para>

<para id="para-00009">Due to the importance of health education, the planning and implementation of education should not be done haphazardly. The process requires significant forethought. The planning process both identifies and prioritizes health problems. During educational planning, nurses identify available resources and then allocate them efficiently. Ultimately, detailed planning can help health care providers develop the most successful methods to educate community members and prevent duplication of activities already being used.</para>

<title>Principles of Planning</title>
<para id="para-00010">Planning a community health education program requires significant preparation. First and foremost, it is crucial to understand the community's health care and educational needs. This can be achieved through a <term id="term-00017">community health needs assessment (CHNA)</term>, which identifies a community's strengths, resources, and current needs. CHNAs establish a foundation for planning and are discussed in detail in <link document="m00187">Assessment, Analysis, and Diagnosis</link>. Additionally, nurses must consider the potential learners’ interests and motivations. Programs that do not appeal to these interests will have limited client participation. For example, if the community health nurse identifies increasing rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and wishes to initiate a community health education plan to reduce these rates but the community members do not believe this is a pressing concern, the nurse will not receive support and the initiative will likely be unsuccessful. The initiative may fail if community members do not participate in the health education program or funders and government officials do not support the plan.</para>
<para id="para-00011">Additionally, creating health education activities with the people involved in their implementation will likely increase participation and acceptance. For example, if those teaching the content are involved in planning, the intervention will likely be more successful. Examples of health education activities may include classes, courses, workshops, seminars, conversations, media advertisements, and/or webinars. These activities may use multiple forms of information dissemination, such as websites, videos, books, pictures, and/or software programs (Rural Health Information Hub, 2023). While creating health education activities, nurses should consider available community resources. Examples of resources are time, personnel, training, and financial organization. The planned educational activity should be achievable using these resources.</para>
<para id="para-00012">The nurse and health care team must remember to be flexible. While they should complete essential planning before program implementation, modifying plans along the way may be necessary to better serve the community. These alterations could be due to a change in resources or a change in problems if a new, more urgent problem develops. Health care providers must be trained and supported to effectively deliver education programs and maintain program implementation consistency. A successful health education program should be <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">holistic</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">intersectional,</term> participative, and equitable (World Health Organization [WHO], 2023). Health education programs can be guided by theoretical frameworks or models. Theoretical frameworks and models that can be used in program planning are discussed in <link document="m00192">Planning Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Interventions</link>.</para>

<title>Chapter Summary</title>
<para id="para-00013">Planning health education should be taken seriously using a multidisciplinary approach. Planning principles include completing a community health needs assessment to identify a community’s strengths, resources, and needs. Planning requires consideration of the community’s interests to obtain buy-in and participation. Additional factors to consider in planning should include using evidence-based teaching materials and considering the target population’s health literacy, different abilities, and culture. Cultural sensitivity should be the foundation for planned interventions to ensure they meet the needs of the community in question while respecting its culture.</para>
