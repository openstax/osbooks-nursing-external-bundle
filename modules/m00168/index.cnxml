<para id="para-00002">Recall from <link document="m00158">Epidemiology for Informing Population/Community Health Decisions</link> that <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">endemic disease</term> occurs when an infection or disease becomes common in a population or area. Examples include the annual flu strains, influenza A and B. An <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">epidemic</term> is a notable increase in infection that surpasses the criteria for an endemic level within a defined population or area. These terms can also refer to a new infectious agent that emerges or reemerges. A <term id="term-00003">pandemic</term> is an epidemic that spreads worldwide (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2012). Pandemics have been recorded throughout history. One of the earliest occurred during the Peloponnesian War in 430 BCE as a disease, most likely typhoid fever, passed through Libya, Ethiopia, and Egypt and into Athens, killing as much as two-thirds of the population. The pandemic weakened the Athenians, contributing to their defeat by the Spartans (Onion et al., 2021). Throughout time, pandemics have shaped the course of history and society. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">COVID-19</term> pandemic is the most recent example. This section discusses major pandemics throughout history, beginning with the bubonic plague and then focusing on the 20th- and 21st-century infectious pandemics that have shaped public health and policy.</para>
<section id="sect-00002">
<title>The Plague</title>
<para id="para-00003">The plague, also called the bubonic plague and the Black Death, has caused a few distinct pandemics. The first recorded outbreak of plague, the Plague of Justinian (541–542), claimed the lives of half of Europe’s population (Piret &amp; Boivin, 2020). Beginning in Egypt, it spread throughout the Roman Empire, killing an estimated 100 million people as it rapidly moved along trade and military routes. After this initial outbreak, the plague returned intermittently (Piret &amp; Boivin, 2020).</para>
<para id="para-00004">Likely originating in East Asia, the Black Death pandemic spread through Central Asia and Europe via trade routes. In 1347, 12 ships from the Black Sea docked at a Sicilian port, with most of the sailors dead or ill, covered in boils oozing blood and pus. The authorities ordered the removal from port of these “death ships,” but it was too late. By this time in Europe, the Black Death had claimed an estimated 200 million lives (Frith, 2012; Piret &amp; Boivin, 2020). In 1347, as the pandemic ravaged Europe, Africa, and Asia, officials in Ragusa, Italy, slowed its spread by isolating arriving boats and sailors for an initial 30, and later 40 days, or <emphasis effect="italics">quaranta,</emphasis> the origin of quarantine (Frith, 2012; Hajar, 2012). By the 1350s, the plague had dissipated but continued to reappear intermittently.</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00002">
<item>Successive waves of the plague from 1630 to 1722 affected France, Italy, the Netherlands, and England.</item>
<item>Throughout the 1800s, outbreaks continued in Asia.</item>
<item>In 1865, an outbreak began in Southern China and spread south and west. In 1893, the plague reached colonial India, where public health measures slowed its spread. Approximately 12 million people died during this pandemic (Frith, 2012; Piret &amp; Boivin, 2020).</item>
</list>
<para id="para-00005">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">plague</term> is spread by a flea-borne bacteria, <emphasis effect="italics">Yersinia pestis</emphasis>, that is associated with rodents. Fleas ingest an infected rodent’s blood and then transmit the bacteria to new rodent hosts. The plague has three presentations: bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic. The most common bubonic form begins with flu-like symptoms followed by extreme lymph node swelling and oozing (plague-boils). Untreated, bubonic plague is often fatal. The plague can also present with a blood infection or progress from bubonic to a blood infection, classified as septicemia, with a high fatality rate if untreated. The extremely contagious, rapidly fatal pneumonic plague occurs when infection spreads to the lungs and is spread via droplet contact from person to person. The cause of the plague was unknown until 1897 when, during the plague pandemic in India, it was discovered to be caused by a bacterium (Frith, 2012).</para>
<para id="para-00006">Over the 19th and 20th centuries, sanitation and public health practices alleviated the plague’s high <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">mortality rate</term> and economic devastation, but they did not eradicate it completely. According to the CDC, most U.S. human plague cases occur in northern New Mexico, northern Arizona, southern Colorado, southern Oregon, and western Nevada. More than 80 percent of cases of plague are bubonic (CDC, 2022aa). From 2015 to 2020, 36 cases were documented in the United States, with six recorded deaths. Plague epidemics continue globally today; most cases since 1990 have been in Africa among individuals living in small towns, villages, or agricultural areas (CDC, 2022aa). Many public health measures used during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as medical inspections, isolation of sick individuals, ship restrictions and quarantines, or the control of the movement of individuals and materials, originated during the Black Death (Frith, 2012; Piret &amp; Boivin, 2020).</para>

<title>Influenza Pandemic of 1918</title>
<para id="para-00007">The avian vector-borne <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">influenza</term> pandemic of 1918, also called the Spanish Flu, was one of the most severe pandemics in recent history. Caused by the influenza A H1N1 virus, it spread globally in 1918–1919, coinciding with World War I (WWI) (CDC, 2019a). The overcrowding and global troop movements associated with WWI likely facilitated its global transmission. A main characteristic of this influenza virus was that it resulted in a high mortality in healthy people aged 20–40 (CDC, 2019a; Klein, 2020). Lack of a vaccine and treatment and the susceptibility of young, healthy adults created a public health crisis, resulting in almost 700,000 deaths in the United States and at least 50 million deaths globally (CDC, 2018a; CDC, 2019a). This flu lowered the average life expectancy in the United States by more than 12 years (Klein, 2020).</para>

<para id="para-00009">The response to the 1918 flu pandemic was fragmented. No pharmacologic treatments or vaccines existed, and the United States lacked a government agency dedicated to disease control and prevention. In the fall of 1918, the number of professional nurses deployed to military camps throughout the United States and abroad to aid in the war effort resulted in a significant nursing shortage, further exacerbated by the failure to use trained Black nurses (CDC, 2018a). The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">American Red Cross</term> issued urgent requests for volunteers to assist in nursing the sick. In Philadelphia, where the pandemic hit hard, hundreds of corpses awaited burial in cold-storage plants that served as temporary morgues (CDC, 2018a). Many cities closed theaters, movie houses, and night schools and prohibited public gatherings. By the end of 1918, public health officials began educating the public about the danger of coughing, sneezing, and carelessly disposing of nasal discharge (CDC, 2018a). The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">American Public Health Association</term> encouraged businesses to stagger their hours to prevent public transportation overcrowding (CDC, 2018a). Cities like San Francisco implemented <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">mask mandates</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">physical distancing</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">isolation</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">quarantine</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">disinfection</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">hygiene</term> measures. The implementation of these measures and reporting of actual disease numbers were inconsistent (CDC, 2018a; CDC, 2019a). Although the military created field hospitals dedicated to soldiers infected with influenza to isolate them from healthy soldiers, more soldiers died from the flu than in combat (<link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00168"/>) (National Archives and Records Administration, n.d.; CDC, 2019a). Finally, by the summer of 1919, the flu faded as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">immunity</term> developed (CDC, 2019a).</para>

Following the 1918 pandemic, public health policies and practices continued to improve with each subsequent pandemic due to surveillance and education, sanitation, and isolation strategies (Matta et al., 2020).</para>

<title>HIV/AIDS Pandemic</title>
<para id="para-00011">In June 1981, the CDC went on alert when five healthy young men in California developed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), a rare and often deadly disease. Health officials next recognized an unusual increase in Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) cases among gay men in New York. Outbreaks of these rare diseases were alarming, especially since they occured within the same population (CDC, 2021a). The media and health care professionals used the term <emphasis effect="italics">gay-related immune deficiency</emphasis> (GRID) to describe the new virus, resulting in severe stigmatization of the homosexual community (Ayala &amp; Spieldenner, 2021). In late 1981, cases appeared in heterosexual intravenous (IV) drug users and, shortly thereafter, in individuals with hemophilia. In response, the CDC issued guidelines on the care of individuals with <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">HIV</term>, including wearing gloves when exposed to blood and other bodily fluids (CDC, 2021a). At the start of the pandemic, the median survival time for a person with <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">AIDS</term> was one to two years (Eisinger &amp; Fauci, 2018). The identification in 1983 of a retrovirus that causes HIV led to the first HIV test in 1985 (Beyrer, 2021).</para>
<para id="para-00012">While the HIV/AIDS pandemic officially began in 1981, the disease is believed to have developed in the late 1800s from a chimpanzee virus in Central Africa that spread slowly, reaching the United States in the mid-to-late 1970s (CDC, 2022a). At that time, sporadic cases in the United States were not known to be caused by HIV/AIDS (CDC, 2022a). In the 21st century, AIDS has become one of the largest public health challenges, killing more than 39 million people worldwide, including 500,000 in the United States (CDC, 2021a). Today, an estimated 1.2 million people in the United States (CDC, 2023a) and an estimated 39 million people globally, the majority in sub-Saharan Africa, live with HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS, n.d.). The United Nations (2022) reports that the “AIDS pandemic continues to be responsible for more than 13,000 deaths each week” (paragraph 1). Although the number of new HIV infections in the Sub-Saharan Africa has declined, and despite better treatment options and decreased U.S. mortality rates, HIV/AIDS is still a global pandemic (Eisinger &amp; Fauci, 2018). HIV/AIDS continues to expand in parts of eastern Europe, central Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa (Beyrer, 2021). While HIV can be managed with antiretroviral drug therapy, no current vaccine or cure for AIDS exists (CDC, 2021a).</para>

<title>COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
<para id="para-00014">In December 2019, a cluster of individuals in Wuhan, China, began experiencing symptoms of an atypical pneumonia-like illness that was unresponsive to standard treatments. In January 2020, the WHO announced that these outbreaks were caused by the 2019 Novel Coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV (CDC, 2022e). The organization officially named the disease <emphasis effect="italics">COVID-19</emphasis> and declared the outbreak a pandemic in March 2020, after it had affected over 100 countries and caused over 4,000 deaths. By August 2020, COVID-19 had become the third leading cause of death in the United States. More than 1,000 people died each day, with the number of confirmed cases surpassing 5.4 million. In a 10-month period, the reported mortality from COVID-19 exceeded 1 million globally (<link target-id="fig-00002" document="m00168"/>) (CDC, 2022e).</para>
<para id="para-00015">Developing a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">vaccine</term> to prevent COVID-19 became a global imperative. Approximately one year after the initial outbreak, in December 2020, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</term> (FDA) issued an <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00021">Emergency Use Authorization</term> for two different COVID-19 vaccines for people age 16 years and older.</para>
<para id="para-00016">Like other pandemics throughout history, COVID-19 helped shape the public health system and the government response to public health threats. Pandemic responses have led to advances like sanitation, isolation, quarantine, and vaccine development and have taught public health workers lessons about the importance of early response and mitigation efforts to decrease morbidity and mortality. The HIV/AIDS pandemic shaped domestic public health policy by challenging the stigmatization of groups of individuals, protecting human rights, and ensuring scientific evidence guides the actions of public health with the dissemination of correct information on modes of transmission, prevention, and potential treatments (Somse &amp; Eba, 2020).</para>
