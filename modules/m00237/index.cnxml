<para id="para-00002">Electrolytes are minerals that carry electrical charges and play vital roles in maintaining fluid homeostasis and regulating various physiological functions. When there are imbalances in electrolytes, it can lead to a range of symptoms and health issues that can significantly impact an individual’s health and well-being. Therefore, it is important to maintain proper electrolyte balance through a healthy diet, hydration, and medical care.</para>
<section id="sect-00002">
<title>Electrolytes</title>
<para id="para-00003"><term id="term-00001">Electrolytes</term> are found in ICF and ECF compartments. They are responsible for many functions including regulating nerves, muscle function, and fluid balance within the body and helping to maintain a healthy pH level. In the next few sections, you will learn about potassium, sodium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and chloride.</para>
<section id="sect-00003">
<title>Potassium</title>
<para id="para-00004"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">Potassium (K)</term> is an essential cation primarily found inside cells. The normal intracellular concentration of potassium ions in the body is approximately 140 mEq/L; the normal extracellular concentration is around 4 mEq/L. Therapeutic serum potassium levels are 3.6 to 5.4 mEq/L (Shrimanker &amp; Bhattarai, 2023).</para>
<para id="para-00005">Potassium moves into and out of the cells via the <term id="term-00003">sodium-potassium-ATPase pump</term> (see <link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00237"/>), which uses energy from ATP hydrolysis to transport sodium ions out of cells and potassium ions into cells, against their concentration gradients. The pump is vital for maintaining the concentration gradient of sodium and potassium ions across the cell membrane (Shrimanker &amp; Bhattarai, 2023).</para>
<para id="para-00006">The levels of potassium in the body are influenced by acid–base imbalances. Acidotic conditions can lead to the movement of potassium out of cells, whereas alkalotic conditions can promote movement of potassium into cells. There is an inverse relationship between sodium and potassium reabsorption in the kidneys. Additionally, the hormone aldosterone plays a role in regulating potassium excretion (Shrimanker &amp; Bhattarai, 2023).</para>
<para id="para-00007">Potassium is necessary for transmission and conduction of nerve impulses and for contraction of skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscles. It is essential for normal renal function and <term id="term-00004">glycolysis,</term> the process of converting glucose into energy. Potassium also promotes glycogen storage in hepatic cells and regulates osmolality of cellular fluids (Dalga et al., 2023; Shrimanker &amp; Bhattarai, 2023).</para>
<section id="sect-00004">
<title>Hyperkalemia</title>
<para id="para-00008"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">Hyperkalemia</term> is a condition where the level of potassium in the blood is higher than normal (usually above 5.0 mEq/L) (Shrimanker &amp; Bhattarai, 2023). Common causes include excessive potassium intake, impaired kidney function that decreases its excretion, or a shift from intracellular to extracellular spaces.</para>
<para id="para-00009">Manifestations of hyperkalemia include muscle weakness, fatigue, palpitations, tachycardia, paresthesia, nausea, diarrhea, and confusion. EKG changes such as peaked T waves, flattened P waves, and prolonged QRS durations may be seen. In severe cases, hyperkalemia can cause cardiac arrest (Shrimanker &amp; Bhattarai, 2023).</para>
<para id="para-00010">Treatment for hyperkalemia includes removing excess potassium from the body through dialysis, administering drugs that shift potassium from the extracellular fluid into the cells, administering <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">potassium binding drugs</term> that help bind to potassium and excrete it from the body, and treating the underlying cause. Common underlying causes of hyperkalemia include kidney failure and diabetes (Shrimanker &amp; Bhattarai, 2023).</para>
<para id="para-00011">Nursing implications include restricting potassium in the diet. The health care provider may order administration of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">sodium bicarbonate</term> (which elevates the pH level and moves potassium back into cells, thereby lowering the serum potassium levels), <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">insulin</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">glucose</term> (insulin helps to move potassium back into the cells by promoting the uptake of glucose and potassium), and/or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">sodium polystyrene sulfonate</term> (which exchanges sodium ions for potassium ions in the colon, leading to removal of excess potassium through the stool). Monitoring potassium levels and reporting significant changes to the health care provider is key in ensuring appropriate potassium balance within the body (Shrimanker &amp; Bhattarai, 2023).</para>
<para id="para-00012">Clients should avoid food high in potassium (such as bananas, potatoes, and spinach), should avoid salt substitutes (as these are high in potassium), take drugs as prescribed, and seek medical attention if they develop manifestations of hyperkalemia, such as palpitations, tachycardia, and muscle weakness.</para>
</section>
<section id="sect-00005">
<title>Hypokalemia</title>
<para id="para-00013"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">Hypokalemia</term> is a condition where the level of potassium in the blood is lower than normal (less than 3.5 mEq/L). Hypokalemia can be caused by excessive loss of potassium through the kidneys, increased loss of potassium in the digestive tract (through vomiting or diarrhea), insufficient potassium intake, redistribution of potassium from extracellular fluid into cells (by insulin therapy, alkalosis, or drugs), or by a magnesium deficiency (magnesium is necessary for the proper function of channels that regulate potassium transport in cells) (Shrimanker &amp; Bhattarai, 2023).</para>
<para id="para-00014">Manifestations of hypokalemia include fatigue, muscle weakness, muscle cramps, constipation, and irregular heartbeat. EKG changes may be present with T wave inversion, widespread ST depression, and prominent U waves (Shrimanker &amp; Bhattarai, 2023).</para>
<para id="para-00015">Treatment for hypokalemia includes administering <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">potassium supplements</term> orally or intravenously, treating the underlying cause, and monitoring for complications such as low blood pressure. Common underlying causes of hypokalemia include diarrhea, diuretic use, excessive laxative use, excessive sweating, and diabetic ketoacidosis. Adverse reactions with potassium supplements include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Potassium supplements should be used cautiously with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), ACE inhibitors, and potassium-sparing diuretics such as spironolactone.</para>
<para id="para-00016">Nursing implications include monitoring potassium levels, assessing for manifestations of hypokalemia, and administering potassium supplements as prescribed by the health care provider. Clients should eat a diet containing potassium-rich foods (such as bananas, lentils, and dried fruits). Clients should avoid excessive use of laxatives or diuretics and report symptoms of hypokalemia, such as muscle weakness and constipation, to their health care provider.</para>

<title>Potassium and IV Bolus or Push</title>
<para id="para-00017">Never push or bolus potassium intravenously. Rapid administration of potassium via intravenous bolus or push can result in cardiac dysrhythmias and client death. Intravenous potassium solutions are often premixed (diluted in 100–1000 mL of normal saline or lactated Ringer’s solutions) to decrease the risk of errors.</para>

<note class="clinical-tip" id="note-00002">
<title>Potassium Administration and IV Site Assessment</title>
<para id="para-00018">Monitor the client’s IV site closely when administering potassium intravenously for infiltration, because potassium solutions can cause extravasation and tissue necrosis if they infiltrate into subcutaneous tissues. Discontinue the IV fluids immediately if this occurs and notify the health care provider. Maximum potassium concentration is 40 mEq/L with a maximum peripheral infusion rate of 20 mEq/hour (Sur &amp; Mohiuddin, 2022).</para>

<title>Sodium</title>
<para id="para-00019"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">Sodium (Na)</term> is predominantly an extracellular cation, meaning it is found primarily outside of the cells in the extracellular fluid. The normal concentration of sodium in the body is approximately 135 to 145 mEq/L (which is the same as the therapeutic range for serum sodium levels), whereas the normal intracellular concentration is around 10 mEq/L (Shrimanker &amp; Bhattarai, 2023).</para>
<para id="para-00020">The sodium-potassium-ATPase pump is vital for maintaining the concentration gradient of sodium and potassium ions across the cell membrane. As you may recall, the pump uses energy to move sodium out of cells and potassium into cells against their concentration gradients, in order to maintain sodium–potassium balance (Shrimanker &amp; Bhattarai, 2023).</para>
<para id="para-00021">Sodium has many functions within the body. It is the primary determinant of the osmolality and volume of extracellular fluids. It is involved in the transmission of nerve impulses throughout the body, including the brain and nervous system. Sodium is important for proper muscle contraction and relaxation. Potassium and sodium work together to regulate blood pressure by maintaining the proper fluid balance. Sodium helps to maintain the pH balance of the blood. Additionally, sodium is necessary for the absorption of certain nutrients such as glucose and amino acids in the small intestine (Shrimanker &amp; Bhattarai, 2023; Veniamakis et al., 2022).</para>
<section id="sect-00007">
<title>Hypernatremia</title>
<para id="para-00022"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">Hypernatremia</term> is a condition in which the sodium levels in the blood are higher than normal (above 145 mEq/L). As sodium levels rise, hypertonicity occurs, and water shifts out of the ICF space into the ECF. This can be caused by dehydration, excessive salt intake, deficient water intake, or kidney problems (Shrimanker &amp; Bhattarai, 2023).</para>
<para id="para-00023">Manifestations of hypernatremia include thirst, dry mucous membranes, flushed dry skin, elevated body temperature, muscle twitching, seizure, and coma. Treatment for hypernatremia involves correcting the underlying cause and restoring fluid and electrolyte balance. Intravenous fluids and drugs to lower sodium levels may be administered gradually.</para>
<para id="para-00024">Nursing implications include monitoring intake and output as well as electrolyte levels. IV fluids and drugs such as diuretics are administered as needed.</para>

<para id="para-00026"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">Hyponatremia</term> is a condition in which sodium levels are lower than normal (less than 135 mEq/L). As sodium levels decrease, hypotonicity occurs, and water shifts from the ECF into the ICF. This can be caused by conditions such as kidney disease, heart failure, or excessive fluid intake (Shrimanker &amp; Bhattarai, 2023). Manifestations of hyponatremia include muscle weakness, decreased deep tendon reflexes, headache, lethargy, confusion, weak or thready pulse, decreased blood pressure, seizures, and coma.</para>
<para id="para-00027">Treatment for hyponatremia includes correcting the underlying cause and restoring fluid and electrolyte balance. Oral sodium replacement or intravenous fluids may be necessary to restore homeostasis. Adverse reactions include hypertension and fluid volume excess. Sodium replacement supplements should be used cautiously in clients with advanced renal disorders or heart failure.</para>
<para id="para-00028">Nursing implications include monitoring intake and output of sodium and electrolyte levels, administering oral sodium replacements or intravenous solutions as ordered by the health care provider, and client education on fluid intake.</para>

<title>Calcium</title>
<para id="para-00030"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">Calcium (Ca)</term> is the fifth most abundant mineral in the body and is present in both intracellular and extracellular fluid compartments. In the ECF, calcium is present in ionized and protein-bound forms; in ICF, calcium is primarily bound to proteins and organelles. The therapeutic range for serum calcium levels is 8.8 to 10.4 mg/dL (Drake &amp; Gupta, 2022; Shrimanker &amp; Bhattarai, 2023).</para>
<para id="para-00031">Calcium is necessary for the formation and maintenance of bones and teeth. It is also important for proper muscle function, including contraction and relaxation. Calcium is involved in the transmission of nerve impulses and is necessary for the release of certain hormones and enzymes. Additionally, calcium is involved in the clotting of blood and helps to regulate heart rhythm (Shrimanker &amp; Bhattarai, 2032). Calcium has an inverse relationship with phosphorus and a synergistic relationship with magnesium. The parathyroid hormone from the parathyroid gland and calcitonin from the thyroid gland regulate calcium levels. The absorption of calcium requires activated vitamin D.</para>

<title>Hypochloremia</title>
<para id="para-00066"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00027">Hypochloremia</term> is a condition where there is a low amount of chloride in the blood (less than 98 mEq/L). It may be caused by diarrhea, vomiting, kidney disease, or metabolic alkalosis. Manifestations include weakness, fatigue, trouble breathing, and dizziness (Fishman, 2023; Lewin, 2018; Shrimanker &amp; Bhattarai, 2023).</para>
<para id="para-00067">Treatment is focused on treating the underlying cause, replacing fluids and electrolytes, and drug or drug dosage adjustments. Adverse effects include fever and fluid volume excess. Fluid replacement with chloride-containing solutions should be administered cautiously in clients with heart failure and kidney disorders.</para>
<para id="para-00068">Nursing implications include monitoring intake and output, administering fluids and electrolytes per health care provider orders, and monitoring for signs of fluid volume excess, such as shortness of breath, crackles, and peripheral edema, from overtreatment.</para>
