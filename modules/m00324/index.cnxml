<para id="para-00002">Health promotion and disease prevention must focus on chronic, noncommunicable diseases and communicable diseases because the prevention of chronic diseases has become a major public health concern. Cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer are leading causes of death and disability in adults globally; in the United States alone, one in three deaths each year occurs due to heart disease, stroke, or other cardiovascular diseases (National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 2022c). The good news is that many of these chronic diseases are preventable through efforts that target lifestyle modification and appropriate health behaviors. Therefore, promoting and maintaining good health practices among adults is critical for preventing chronic diseases and improving quality of life. While chronic diseases are a significant concern for adults, communicable diseases also substantially threaten public health. Influenza, tuberculosis, and STIs are only some illnesses caused by infectious agents, which spread from person to person without efforts to control this spread. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">COVID-19</term> pandemic demonstrated the importance of preventing the spread of infection (National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, 2023).</para>
<para id="para-00003">This section discusses various aspects of adult health promotion and disease prevention, including healthy lifestyle habits, recommended screenings and immunizations, the impact of both communicable and noncommunicable diseases on vulnerable populations, and the importance of cultural competence in addressing these health issues. By understanding and implementing these activities into their lives, adults can protect themselves and their communities while also improving their overall health and well-being.</para>

<title>Major Diseases Affecting Adults</title>
<para id="para-00004">In the United States, several major diseases affect adults, leading to significant mortality (see <link target-id="table-00001" document="m00324"/>). These diseases cause physical limitations, significantly impact quality of life, and increase health care costs. Nurses must understand the causes, risk factors, and preventive measures associated with these diseases to help reduce their burden on the population and promote healthy living. Of these 13 diseases, 11 are noncommunicable diseases.</para>

<title>Coronary Artery Disease</title>
<para id="para-00005"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">Coronary artery disease (CAD)</term>, also called coronary heart disease or ischemic heart disease, (CDC, 2021j) occurs when plaque buildup in the wall of the coronary arteries (atherosclerosis) leads to a decreased blood supply to the heart. Risks factors for CAD include being overweight, unhealthy eating, and smoking tobacco. CAD also has genetic connections, particularly a family history of heart disease before age 50. For many, the first indicator of CAD is a heart attack.</para>

<section id="sect-00005">
<title>Cancer</title>
<para id="para-00006"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">Cancer</term> occurs when abnormal cells divide out of control and can invade other tissues (CDC, 2021f). Cancer cells can also spread to other body parts through the blood and lymph symptoms. There are more than 100 different types of cancer. Some cancers are preventable, and others are not. One of every five deaths in the United States is due to cancer (U.S. Cancer Statistics Working Group, 2022). One leading cause of cancer is smoking. Lung cancer has been known to be caused by smoking for many years, but smoking can cause cancer in other areas of the body, including the blood, bladder, cervix, colon and rectum, esophagus, kidney, larynx, liver, mouth and throat, pancreas, and stomach. Lowering one’s cancer risk can occur through making healthier choices such as maintaining a healthy weight, limiting alcohol intake, and protecting the skin from UV exposure.</para>

<section id="sect-00006">
<title>Cerebrovascular Disease</title>
<para id="para-00007"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">Cerebrovascular disease</term>, or a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">stroke</term>, is caused when something blocks the blood supply going to a part of the brain or a blood vessel in the brain ruptures (CDC, 2023i). Regardless of the cause, parts of the brain become damaged or die, leading to problems with movements, memories, thoughts, emotions, language, or other body functions. Strokes can occur at any age, but some people are more at risk for developing a stroke. Those with a history of a previous stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">hypertension</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">high cholesterol</term>, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, obesity, and sickle cell disease are at much higher risk of having a stroke. Some lifestyle choices that increase the risk of stroke include (CDC, 2023j)</para>

</list>
<para id="para-00008">There are also genetic components to stroke risk and factors related to age, sex, race, and ethnicity. Individuals aged 55 and older are more likely to have a stroke, and they are more common in women than men. Those who are non-Hispanic Black or Pacific Islander are more likely to die from a stroke than non-Hispanic White people, Hispanic people, AIAN, and Asians. Black people have a higher risk of having a first stroke and are more likely to die from a stroke than White people (CDC, 2023j).</para>

<title>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</title>
<para id="para-00009">Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a group of diseases that cause blocking of airflow and other breathing-related problems. COPD includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Tobacco smoking is the primary cause of COPD; other causes are related to exposure to air pollutants in the home and workplace, genetic factors, and a history of respiratory infections. The CDC (2021h) reports that women; people aged 65 and older; AIAN and multiracial non-Hispanic people; those who are unemployed, retired, or unable to work; those with less than a high school education; those who are divorced, widowed, or separated; current or former smokers; and those with a history of asthma are more likely to develop COPD.</para>

<title>Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
<para id="para-00010"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">Alzheimer’s disease</term> is the most common type of dementia. It begins with mild memory loss and then progresses to the inability to hold a conversation or respond to the environment appropriately, causing severe difficulties in performing activities of daily living (CDC, 2020d). Alzheimer’s disease impacts the part of the brain that controls thoughts, memories, and language. Much remains to be learned about this disease. The best-known risk factor for developing Alzheimer’s disease is age. There are also beliefs that genetics play a role in its development. There are findings that a healthy lifestyle could decrease the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease (CDC, 2020d).</para>

<title>Diabetes</title>
<para id="para-00013">Diabetes is a chronic health condition caused by the body either not making enough insulin or not using insulin as well as it should. When either of these occurs, too much blood sugar remains in the bloodstream (CDC, 2022e). Over time, the increased blood sugar can lead to serious health problems, including heart disease, vision difficulties, and kidney disease. More than one in three adults in the United States have prediabetes, with blood sugar levels higher than normal but not high enough to develop type 2 diabetes, and over 80 percent of adults do not know they have prediabetes (CDC, 2022j). Even prediabetes can increase the risk of heart disease and stroke. Prediabetes can be viewed as an opportunity to prevent type 2 diabetes. See <link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00324"/> for more about prediabetes.</para>
<para id="para-00014">The three types of diabetes are type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and gestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes was discussed briefly earlier in this chapter. Type 1 diabetes involves the body not making enough insulin, perhaps due to an immune reaction. Risk factors for this type of diabetes are family history and age, as it usually develops in children, teens, or young adults. White people in the United States are more likely to develop type 1 diabetes than Black or Hispanic people (CDC, 2022j). There is no known way to prevent type 1 diabetes. In type 2 diabetes, the pancreas makes less insulin than previously, and the body becomes resistant to it. Type 2 diabetes can sometimes be preventable with healthy diet and activity. There are a variety of factors that put a person at risk for type 2 diabetes, including</para>

</list>
<para id="para-00015">Also, more than half of women with PCOS develop type 2 diabetes by age 40, likely related to insulin resistance that occurs with PCOS (CDC, 2022x). Diabetes is the primary cause of kidney failure, lower-limb amputations, and adult blindness. The number of adults diagnosed with diabetes has more than doubled over the last 20 years. Of the adult U.S. population, 38 percent have prediabetes (CDC, 2022j).</para>

<title>Chronic Liver Disease</title>
<para id="para-00016"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">Chronic liver disease</term> is a progressive deterioration of liver function, which includes the production of clotting factors and other proteins, detoxification of harmful metabolism products, and bile excretion. Cirrhosis is the final stage of chronic liver disease. The most common causes of chronic liver disease are alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, chronic viral hepatitis, and certain genetic and autoimmune causes. Other causes of chronic liver disease include use of certain drugs (amiodarone, isoniazid, methotrexate, phenytoin, and nitrofurantoin) and the vascular Budd-Chiari syndrome (Sharma &amp; Nagalli, 2022). Of the causes, it is possible to deter chronic liver disease by limiting the use of over-the-counter pain medications and consumption of high-fat foods and alcohol and reducing the risk of developing hepatitis through vaccination, safer sex practices, and good hygiene.</para>

<title>Chronic Kidney Disease</title>
<para id="para-00017"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">Chronic kidney disease</term> involves the damage of kidneys such that they cannot filter blood to remove wastes, toxins, and excess fluid. This excess fluid and waste remain in the body, leading to heart disease and stroke. The kidneys also help control blood pressure, stimulate the production of red blood cells, keep the bones healthy, and regulate important chemicals such as sodium, potassium, and calcium (CDC, 2022c). Risk factors for chronic kidney disease include diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, a family history of chronic kidney disease, and obesity. Following a healthy lifestyle and addressing any of the conditions that are risk factors can help decrease the effects or prevent chronic kidney disease.</para>

<title>Educational Interventions to Promote Self-Care in Adults</title>
<para id="para-00022">The WHO (2022d, para. 2) defines <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">self-care</term> as “the ability of individuals, families, and communities to promote their own health, prevent disease, maintain health, and to cope with illness and disability with or without the support of a health professional.” The concept of self-care recognizes individuals as active participants in managing their health in various areas, including health promotion, disease prevention and control, self-medication, providing care to dependent persons, and rehabilitation, including palliative care. Self-care is not intended to replace the need for the formal health care system but allows a different option to receive health care.</para>
<para id="para-00023">Some examples of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">educational interventions</term> that may be used to promote self-care in the adult population include the following:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00007">
<item>Health education classes: can provide individuals or groups with information on topics such as healthy eating, physical activity, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">stress management</term>, and disease prevention. Classes can be offered in various settings, such as community centers, workplaces, or health care facilities.</item>
<item>Self-help materials: brochures, pamphlets, and books can provide individuals with information to maintain good health and prevent illness and can be made available in waiting rooms, libraries, and other public spaces.</item>
<item>Workshops: can focus on learning practical self-care skills, such yoga or healthy cooking; may be led by health care professionals, community leaders, or trained volunteers.</item>
<item>Mobile health applications (apps): can provide individuals with personalized health information, reminders, and tracking tools to help them maintain healthy habits. Apps are downloaded on smartphones and are available at any time.</item>

<title>Healthy People 2030 Goals for Adults</title>
<para id="para-00025">Several <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">Healthy People 2030</term> goals specifically target the health of the adult population. Healthy People 2030 divides these into goals for men and goals for women. The overarching goal for men is to “improve health and well-being for men” (ODPHP, n.d.-d, para. 1), and the overarching goal for women is to “promote health and well-being for women” (ODPHP, n.d.-i, para. 1).</para>
<para id="para-00026">The difference in the wording of the Healthy People 2030 goals for each sex is likely because men die an average of 5 years earlier than women (ODPHP, n.d.-d). According to the NCHS (2022d),</para>
<para id="para-00027">Life expectancy at birth for women in the United States dropped 0.8 years from 79.9 years in 2020 to 79.1 in 2021, while life expectancy for men dropped one full year, from 74.2 years in 2020 to 73.2 in 2021. The report shows the disparity in life expectancy between men and women grew in 2021 from 5.7 years in 2020 to 5.9 years in 2021.

<para id="para-00031">These Healthy People 2030 goals and objectives reflect the importance of promoting healthy behaviors, preventing chronic diseases, and improving mental health in adults. This can be achieved by addressing some of the SDOH, mentioned previously in this chapter and in <link document="m00140"><emphasis effect="bold">Social Determinants Affecting Health Outcomes</emphasis></link>. For instance, increasing access to healthy, safe, and affordable food can improve the nutrition and health of adults (<link target-id="fig-00002" document="m00324"/>). There are a variety of factors contributing to access of such foods (ODPHP, n.d.-e):</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00009">
<item>Availability: The location, number, variety, and quality of grocery stores, food services, and farmers markets affects the availability of healthy foods in the community.</item>
<item>Cost: The cost of foods affects which items adults can afford or choose to purchase. The availability of produce and other healthier items can be limited and often more expensive at convenience stores or smaller food markets.</item>
<item>Transportation: Access to reliable transportation can make it easier to travel for food and gives adults more choice in where they obtain food. Less access to reliable transportation can be a challenge for those living in rural communities.</item>
<item>Community Programs: Local participation in community food support programs can help reduce prices and encourage healthier food choices, such as farmers markets that accept payment using Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits.</item>

<title>Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Activities to Improve the Health of Adults</title>
<para id="para-00032">Many health promotion activities for adults focus on addressing the short list of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">risk behaviors</term> that lead to chronic illness; these include tobacco use, poor nutrition, physical inactivity, and excessive alcohol use. By engaging in health promotion activities, adults can improve their health, reduce their risk of chronic diseases, and create supportive environments that make healthy choices easier and more accessible. Mitigation of 7 of the 10 diseases shown in <link target-id="table-00001" document="m00324"/> can occur by addressing these behaviors. The CDC’s National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (2022c) provides detailed approaches to address these behaviors, including</para>

<para id="para-00034">Adulthood comes with many responsibilities and increased productivity. From the ages of 18 through 65 years, significant biological, physiological, social, and psychological changes occur (Mayo Clinic, 2023). During this time, adults develop relationships with significant others, marriages or partnerships, families, and careers while making lifelong decisions. All of this impacts the health of adults.</para>
<para id="para-00035">Nurses are integral to fostering health promotion and disease prevention in U.S. adults. Along with individual, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">client-centered care</term>, the nurse may need to provide family-centered and workplace health promotion and disease prevention to best address the health of this population. Despite the environment of care, nurses play a critical role in promoting health and preventing disease in adults (Melariri et al., 2022). Nurses often conduct health assessments to identify risk factors and develop individualized, family, and population plans. This may include assessing lifestyle factors or screening for chronic diseases. Nurses provide education to individual and adult populations on healthy lifestyle behaviors, disease prevention, and self-care management. Nurses perform preventative measures to detect and prevent diseases, such as administering immunizations, performing screenings, and providing counseling. Nurses coordinate care for adults with complex health needs through referrals to appropriate health care providers, community resources, or social services to assist in meeting their needs. Finally, nurses advocate for the adult population by promoting policies and environments that support health and prevent disease, such as working to address SDOH that contribute to health disparities (Melariri et al., 2022).</para>

<title>Primary Prevention</title>
<para id="para-00036"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020">Primary prevention</term> involves taking measures to prevent health problems or injuries before they happen. A variety of primary prevention strategies can be used in the adult population. Some of these include the following:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00012">
<item><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00021">Immunizations</term>: Immunizations are a highly effective mechanism of preventing infectious diseases such as influenza, pneumonia, COVID-19, and hepatitis B. The HPV vaccine can prevent several different types of cancer (CDC, 2023e). See the <link url="https://openstax.org/r/cdcadult">CDC’s 2023 Recommended Adult Immunization Schedule</link> for specific recommendations for adults (CDC, 2023a).</item>
<item><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00022">Health education</term>: Education can alter unhealthy or risky behaviors that could lead to disease or injury and increase resistance to disease or injury should exposure occur. Some examples of health education for the adult population include nutrition, regular exercise, avoidance of smoking, workplace safety, safer sex practices, and sun safety (<link target-id="fig-00003" document="m00324"/>).</item>
<item><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00023">Advocacy</term>: Nurses can advocate for legislation and enforcement to ban or control the use of hazardous products, such as asbestos, or to mandate safe and healthy practices, such as the use of seat belts.</item>
</list>
<para id="para-00037">An example of primary prevention involves preventing musculoskeletal disorders such as lower back pain, neck and shoulder pain, wrist strain, and tendonitis. These are among the leading causes of work-related disability that are associated with prescription opioid use and can progress into substance use disorder (Le &amp; Rosen, 2021). Many employers do not see the connection between unhealthy working conditions, workplace injury and illness, and opioid use or addiction. Primary prevention can occur by addressing musculoskeletal disorders and implementing proper ergonomics in the workplace. For example, nurse can educate workers to use their arm and leg muscles for lifting rather than their back. Implementing a work site stretch and flex program can prepare the employee’s body for the shift ahead ( ResponsAble Safety Staffing, 2018). Also, providing personal protective equipment (PPE) designed specifically to reduce the risk of injury, such as shoulder and knee pads, can prevent injury. These strategies can prevent the progression to a substance use disorder and reduce workers’ compensation, health care, social security, and other disability costs associated with work-related injuries (Le &amp; Rosen, 2021). <link document="m00338">Caring Across Practice Settings</link> discusses occupational health in more detail.</para>

<title>Secondary Prevention</title>
<para id="para-00038"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">Secondary prevention</term> is critical for detecting and treating diseases early before they progress and cause significant harm. Screening tests, diagnostic tests, and routine health exams are essential for early detection and treatment of diseases. View the <link url="https://openstax.org/r/highmarkprc">2023 Adult Preventive Health Guidelines: Ages 19 through 64 Years</link> for specific information (Highmark, 2023a). Here are some examples of secondary prevention strategies for adults:</para>

<title>Integration of Sociocultural and Linguistically Responsive Interventions for Adults</title>
<para id="para-00043">Nurses must recognize that a “one size fits all” approach to health promotion and disease prevention may not be effective for all clients. Sociocultural and linguistic factors such as language barriers, cultural beliefs, and SDOH can significantly influence an individual’s health outcomes. Therefore, integrating sociocultural and linguistically responsive interventions into health care is crucial for promoting health equity and improving health outcomes for all individuals, including adults. This section explores the importance of integrating sociocultural and linguistically responsive interventions for adults and some examples of how nurses can effectively implement these interventions into practice.</para>
<section id="sect-00021">
<title>Sociocultural Interventions</title>
<para id="para-00044">By incorporating socioculturally responsive components into the design of health promotion and disease prevention programs, nursing interventions can be more effective in engaging and promoting healthy behaviors among the adult population. Immigrant adults are one specific population that may benefit from such integration. Immigrants face unique cultural barriers to participation in mainstream health promotion programs. These include a lack of access to health care for a variety of reasons, including ineligibility for certain programs, limited support for culturally appropriate health care services, lack of knowledge of the U.S. health care system, distrust of the U.S. health care system, and fears related to deportation with the use of public services (Ali et al., 2021). Other barriers may involve specific customs and unique cultural or religious understandings of health and disease. U.S. immigrants are more likely to be unaware of a chronic disease, such as hypertension, and have lower treatment rates. Ali et al. (2021) determined that while modifiable lifestyle behavioral risk factors must be the common target for hypertension reduction interventions, additional factors should be considered in immigrant communities. These factors include</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00015">
<item>gender roles,</item>
<item>perceptions about physical activity,</item>
<item>demanding work schedules,</item>
<item>neighborhood barriers to healthy living, and</item>
<item>limited physical and financial accessibility to appropriate spaces for healthy activities.</item>
</list>
<para id="para-00045">For example, Oshunluyi et al. (2020) described group-based culturally adapted educational sessions on hypertension for African immigrants that incorporated culturally appropriate storytelling. Ma et al. (2020) described using local libraries, churches, and homes to provide group-based culturally adapted education sessions to Filipino Americans at risk of hypertension. Family members have been shown to have a very strong role in impacting sociocultural and economic factors related to immigrant health and behavior change (Ali et al., 2021). Therefore, family members have been successful as change agents in this population.</para>

<title>Linguistically Responsive Interventions</title>
<para id="para-00046">While sociocultural responsiveness as a whole is imperative in the design of health promotion and disease prevention programs for adults, there is a specific need for linguistic responsive interventions. Kling et al. (2018) described using open, multipurpose rooms inside park recreation centers for group-based multilingual fitness classes. In the classes, five instructors were Hispanic, and four were non-Hispanic Black. Six instructors led the class in English, one led in Spanish, and one led in a mixture of English and Spanish.</para>

<para id="para-00047">Through a focus on the top causes of death in adults, health promotion and disease prevention address both chronic, noncommunicable diseases and communicable diseases. Adult health topics included healthy habits, screenings, immunizations, and the effects of diseases on vulnerable populations. The significance of sociocultural and linguistic factors that impact health were also addressed. These strategies can provide adults with the ability to best safeguard themselves, their communities, and their overall health.</para>
