    <title>The Digestion Process</title>
    <para id="para-00002">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">digestive process</term> includes four steps: ingestion, digestion, absorption, and metabolism. <term id="term-00002">Ingestion</term> is the first step and involves the process of bringing food and liquids into the body through the mouth. Next is <term id="term-00003">digestion</term>, in which the body breaks down solid food through a systemic process that includes both mechanical and chemical actions to form smaller, more absorbable substances for the gastrointestinal tract (Patricia &amp; Dhamoon, 2022). <term id="term-00004">Absorption</term> is when cells take in the broken-down substances, and <term id="term-00005">metabolism</term> is when those absorbed substances are converted to energy.</para>
    <para id="para-00003">Digestion occurs as an integrated process between the body’s upper and lower gastrointestinal tract and accessory organs. The body needs to have proper digestive processes to ensure correct function. Common end products of digestion are amino acids, simple carbohydrates, lipids, vitamins, and minerals.</para>

    <title>Digestive Organs</title>
    <para id="para-00004">The main organs of digestion, known as the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">gastrointestinal system</term>, begin at the mouth and end at the anus. This system is divided into the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">upper gastrointestinal system</term>, which starts at the mouth and ends at the duodenum (the start of the small intestine), and the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">lower gastrointestinal system</term>, which starts at the small intestine and includes the large intestine (the colon, rectum, and anus). Other organs in the digestive system that aid in digestion but are not part of the main gastrointestinal system and don’t come in direct contact with food are the accessory organs: the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">pancreas</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">liver</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">gallbladder</term> (<link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00017"/>).</para>

    <caption>The digestive system consists of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract and accessory systems and is responsible for processing food.

    <para id="para-00005">The purpose of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">digestive system</term>, and all the systems that work in harmony with it, is to receive food, release nutrients and water from the food, and transport these nutrients to the bloodstream for <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">energy</term> production. The digestive system is also responsible for absorbing water from the colon and for excreting nondigestible solid waste from the anus (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 2022).</para>

    <title>Upper Gastrointestinal System</title>
    <para id="para-00006">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">upper gastrointestinal system</term> comprises the mouth, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">esophagus</term>, stomach, and duodenum. The teeth, tongue, and salivary glands, which are all accessories for digestion, are in the mouth and facilitate the breakdown of food through mechanical (chewing) and chemical (enzymes) <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">digestive process</term>es. Without any one of these components, the mouth would not be able to complete its role in the digestive process effectively.</para>
    <para id="para-00007">After this initial breakdown, food then travels out of the mouth, through the upper esophageal sphincter, down the esophagus, through the lower esophageal sphincter, into the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">stomach</term>, out of the stomach through the pyloric sphincter, and into the duodenum (<link target-id="fig-00002" document="m00017"/>). The process of digestion through this upper gastrointestinal tract, starting at the mouth and ending in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">gastric emptying</term>, can take two to five hours to complete (Readman, 2022).</para>
    <figure id="fig-00002"><media alt="This image shows a cross-section of the stomach. The esophagus is the opening at the top of the stomach, while the duodenum is the opening at the bottom."><image mime-type="image/jpg" src="../../media/NUT_Figure_04_00_003.png"/></media>

    <title>Lower Gastrointestinal System</title>
    <para id="para-00008">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020">lower gastrointestinal system</term> comprises the small intestine, large intestine, rectum, and anus. Food entering the lower portion of the gastrointestinal system comes from the duodenum as <term id="term-00021">chyme</term>, a mixture of gastric juices and digested food. After digestive processes are complete in the duodenum, chyme moves through the small intestine, large intestine, and rectum, then out the body through the anus in the form of stool. Digestion through the lower gastrointestinal tract can take from 12 to 65 hours (Readman, 2022).</para>

    <title>Accessory Organs and Systems</title>
    <para id="para-00009">The pancreas, liver, and gallbladder are organs outside of the main gastrointestinal tract but are part of the digestive system (GI Associates and Endoscopy Center, 2022b). They directly aid in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00022">digestion</term> by releasing enzymes and digestive fluids. <term id="term-00023">Cholecystokinin</term>, a hormone produced by the small intestine, triggers the pancreas and gallbladder to contract when fats and proteins enter. The pancreas, while also responsible for other body functions, produces <term id="term-00024">amylase</term>, <term id="term-00025">lipase</term>, <term id="term-00026">trypsinogen</term>, <term id="term-00027">chymotrypsinogen</term>, <term id="term-00028">elastase</term>, <term id="term-00029">carboxypeptidase</term>, <term id="term-00030">nucleases</term>, and <term id="term-00031">protease</term>. These enzymes break down sugars, fats, and starches (GI Associates and Endoscopy Center, 2022b). When sugar enters the bloodstream, the pancreas produces <term id="term-00032">insulin</term>, a hormone that assists in the absorption of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00033">glucose</term> into cells to use for <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00034">energy</term>.</para>
    <para id="para-00010">The liver produces <term id="term-00035">bile</term>, a digestive fluid that is stored in the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00036">gallbladder</term>. When fatty foods enter the duodenum, the gallbladder releases bile to break down the fat into <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00037">fatty acids</term>. If the gallbladder is removed, the bile will instead travel directly from the liver to the small intestine.</para>
    <para id="para-00011">Other accessory organs and tissues that assist in digestion include the saliva glands, tongue, nerves, and blood (University of Rochester Medical Center, 2022). When food enters the mouth and chewing begins, teeth break down the food into smaller parts, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00038">saliva</term> is released. Saliva is released by the sensory system, which is stimulated by sight, smell, and taste. Glands and mucosal membranes of the intestinal walls secrete small amounts of digestive enzymes and lubricating mucus to assist with waste movement and nutrient absorption.</para>

    <title>Congenital Anomalies of the Gastrointestinal System</title>
    <para id="para-00012">While rare, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00039">congenital anomalies</term> can affect the digestive system. Most congenital anomalies result from undeveloped or incorrectly positioned organs, causing blockages that prevent food passage or the exit of waste products (Columbia University Irving Medical Center, n.d.).</para>
    <section id="sect-00008">
    <title>Atresia, Stenosis, and Malformations</title>
    <para id="para-00013">Congenital abnormalities include <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00040">atresia</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00041">stenosis</term>, and malformations. Some of these abnormalities can be detected in utero or soon after birth, while others remain undetected through childhood until they cause physical symptoms (Ludwig et al., 2022). Atresia is a condition in which a passage in the body is blocked. For example, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00042">esophageal atresia</term> is when a baby’s esophagus has not developed correctly, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00043">aural atresia</term> is when the ear canal is underdeveloped. Stenosis, or narrowing, is a partial blockage of an area, and a malformation is an abnormal formation of a specific body part.</para>
    <para id="para-00014"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00044">Anorectal anomalies</term> can include an anus that is very narrow or totally enclosed by a layer of tissue or skin, a rectum that does not connect to the anus (imperforate anus), or a rectum that connects to a part of the urinary or reproductive tract through a <term id="term-00045">fistula</term>, an abnormal connection (Boston Children’s Hospital, 2022). Depending on which anomaly is present, the client may experience symptoms such as difficulty passing stool and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00046">constipation</term>, total inability to have a bowel movement, or stool that exits through the urinary system or another system in the body, causing infection and incontinence (Boston Children’s Hospital, 2022).</para>
    <para id="para-00015"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00047">Biliary anomalies</term> affect the bile ducts. They can involve a progressive narrowing effect and/or a complete blockage, cystic formations that result in blockages in the biliary system, or biliary ducts that are malformed and do not properly connect to the pancreaticobiliary junction (Columbia University Irving Medical Center, n.d.; Stanford Medicine Children’s Health, 2022). These anomalies fall into two main types, cystic and non-cystic. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00048">Cystic anomalies</term> are caused by saclike structures filled with pus or other fluid that form and block different parts of the biliary system, whereas <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00049">non-cystic anomalies</term> are actual structural defects of the biliary system (Stanford Medicine Children’s Health, 2023). Common symptoms of these anomalies include <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00050">jaundice</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00051">abdominal pain</term>, pale or clay-colored <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00052">stools</term>, dark <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00053">urine</term>, enlarged <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00054">liver</term> margins, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00055">hyperamylasemia</term>, enlarged splenic margins, and difficulty gaining weight.</para>

    <section id="sect-00009">
    <title>Malrotation and Volvulus</title>
    <para id="para-00016">Malrotation most often occurs in the small intestine and involves an incorrect rotation that happens during fetal development (Columbia University Irving Medical Center, n.d.). Volvulus is a severe complication of a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00056">malrotation</term> in which blood flow is blocked to the digestive tract, causing <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00057">ischemia</term>, and/or to the intestines, causing stool blockage (Columbia University Irving Medical Center, n.d.). While malrotation can be the cause of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00058">volvulus</term>, it can also occur in the absence of malrotation (John Hopkins Medicine, 2022).</para>
    <para id="para-00017">Malrotations alone are usually asymptomatic. It is not until volvulus develops that a client experiences symptoms (John Hopkins Medicine, 2022) such as sudden and severe nausea and vomiting, dark red or bloody stools, severe constipation or difficulty expelling stools, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00059">abdominal distention</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00060">bilious vomiting</term> (vomiting that contains bile), and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00061">shock</term>.</para>
