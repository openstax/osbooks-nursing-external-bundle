<para id="para-00002">Development of the pulmonary system spans from its initiation in the first trimester of pregnancy through to early adulthood (Arigliani et al., 2018). To assess and analyze the impact of nutrition on the pulmonary system, the nurse must understand the system’s normal function. The pulmonary or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">respiratory system</term> comprises the upper and lower <term id="term-00002">airways</term> (passageways through which air moves), along with the lungs and alveolar sacs. The primary function of the <term id="term-00003">pulmonary system</term> is to ensure adequate <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">oxygenation</term> throughout the body. This occurs with <term id="term-00005">gas exchange</term>, which involves transporting oxygen to the cells and transporting carbon dioxide away from the cells. This process happens through ventilation, diffusion, and perfusion. <term id="term-00006">Ventilation</term> is the movement of atmospheric air that is higher in oxygen into the lungs and the removal of carbon dioxide. Ventilation is the number-one function of the respiratory system. <term id="term-00007">Respiratory diffusion</term> occurs when gases move down the concentration gradient across the alveolar sacs and capillaries. <term id="term-00008">Perfusion</term> is the process of the arterial blood moving through the tissue to the entire body. Adequate gas exchange is essential for all systems of the body. If the pulmonary system is inadequate, total health and well-being can be affected. (Norris, 2019).</para>
<section id="sect-00003">
<title>Normal Function of the Pulmonary System</title>
<para id="para-00003">The normal function of the pulmonary system is best understood when divided into the upper and lower respiratory tract. The respiratory system plays a significant role in ensuring all body systems adequately receive gas exchange for tissue perfusion (<link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00058"/>).</para>

<section id="sect-00004">
<title>Upper Respiratory Tract</title>
<para id="para-00004">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">upper respiratory system</term> is responsible for inhalation and exhalation and also influences speech and the sense of smell. The upper respiratory tract is comprised of the following:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00002">
<item><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">Nose</term>—responsible for smell, which occurs via receptors from the olfactory nerve located in the upper areas of the nose</item>

<item><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">Larynx</term> (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">voice box</term>)—houses the vocal cords, which are responsible for speech</item>
</list>
</section>
<section id="sect-00005">
<title>Lower Respiratory Tract</title>
<para id="para-00005">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">lower respiratory tract</term> is comprised of the airways, lungs, and accessory muscles of respiration. The lower respiratory system is responsible for gas exchange and perfusion.</para>
<para id="para-00006">The lower respiratory tract consists of the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveoli. Gases move to and from the lungs through the airways. The airways only allow for movement of gases, not gas exchange, because the airways are too thick to allow for diffusion. The actual respiratory gas exchange occurs in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">alveolar sacs</term> that arise from the ducts and contain groups of alveoli. <term id="term-00019">Surfactant</term> is a fatty protein that lines the alveoli and reduces surface tension. Without surfactant, <term id="term-00020">atelectasis</term>, which is the collapse of the alveolar, will occur and gas exchange cannot happen, because the collapse causes a reduction of the alveolar area.</para>
<para id="para-00007">The lower airways consist of two elastic lungs located in the pleural cavity of the chest. The two lungs are not equal in size or gas exchange. The right lung is larger and consists of three lobes; the left lung has two lobes. Most of the function (55–60%) occurs in the right lung. If the client’s right lung is compromised, it will interfere with gas exchange and perfusion to a greater extent than a compromised left lung.</para>
<para id="para-00008"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00021">Respirations</term> occur when changes in size of and pressure within the chest cavity take place. The diaphragm and chest muscles contract and relax to cause these changes. When the work of breathing is increased, back and abdominal muscles may be used in addition to chest muscles. When back and abdominal muscles are used, the client is said to be using <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00022">accessory muscles</term> to breathe.</para>
<para id="para-00009">Humans breath in and out approximately 22,000 times a day (Canadian Lung Association, n.d.). While environmental or contaminant factors impact pulmonary function, a natural degradation of function over time also occurs. The following Special Considerations box describes respiratory changes that occur with <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00023">aging</term>. Respiratory changes in older adults can be related to normal aging or respiratory disease. Age-related changes in the muscles and the cardiovascular system may also cause abnormal respirations (Schneider et al., 2021).</para>

<title>Assessment of Nutrition and the Function of the Pulmonary System</title>
<para id="para-00011">The nurse should complete an accurate assessment of the pulmonary system to identify the type and severity of breathing problems that may interfere with gas exchange and be positively impacted by nutritional support. This assessment should include a nutritional history and habits, fluid assessment, and barriers to nutritional goals. This assessment will provide cues to direct the client’s care and enable optimal nutritional intake.</para>
<section id="sect-00007">
<title>Client History</title>
<para id="para-00012">Accurate client information is important to identify how food intake may interfere with pulmonary function. The nurse should be aware that age, gender, and race may affect nutritional needs and risks related to the respiratory system. The client history should include allergies (food and environment), dietary habits, special dietary needs and food sensitivities, food access and/or insecurity, smoking (tobacco and vaping), alcohol, illegal drug use (particularly inhaled substances), travel and environmental exposures, and residential conditions. The history should specifically include the following:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00013">
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Allergies</emphasis>—Include documentation of food, dust, pollen, bee stings, and medications. Document the onset of allergy and the specific allergic response, such as wheezing, difficulty breathing, cough, rhinitis, hives, swollen lips, or anaphylaxis. If the client identifies <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00041">allergies</term>, inquire as to number of prior reactions, treatments utilized, response to treatment, hospitalizations, and if the client has been prescribed and/or carries epinephrine. Food allergies are a risk factor for <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00042">asthma</term> along with asthma morbidity (daytime symptoms, increased rescue therapy, hospitalization, ventilator use, unplanned health care utilization) and mortality (Sherenian et al., 2018).</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Dietary habits</emphasis>—Assess initially with a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00043">24-hour food recall</term>, in which a client reports all their food and fluid intake on the last day (<link target-id="fig-00002" document="m00058"/>). The 24-hour recall is used most often in dietary surveys and has been adapted and validated for use by adolescents and adults, as well as by adults in reporting their child’s intake (Arsenault et al., 2020). While not completely accurate for micronutrient evaluation, the 24-hour food recall can be reviewed and discussed to determine if the reported food intake is typical for the client’s normal routine. For example, if a client typically skips breakfast, eats mostly processed foods or fast food, drinks sugary beverages, and/or eats high-sodium food such as packaged and processed items, this information will assist the nurse in identifying areas for nutrition education.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Special dietary needs</emphasis>—Include specific dietary preferences, religious requirements, or medically indicated restrictions, such as gluten free, diabetic diet, low salt, avoidance of tree nuts or peanuts, kosher, halal, or pork free. Dietary restrictions may put clients at increased risk for <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00044">nutrient deficiency</term> (vitamin E, magnesium, sodium, potassium, and calcium), resulting in increased presence of respiratory symptoms such as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00045">wheezing</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00046">airway hyperreactivity</term> (Sherenian et al., 2018).</item>
<item><term id="term-00047">Social determinants of health (SDOH)</term>—Include conditions in the home, school, work, place of worship, and social environments that affect health, quality of life, and risks for illness (Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion [ODPHP], 2020). Economic and social conditions may limit or create uncertain access to adequate food, known as food insecurity. Restrictions may result from insufficient monetary resources, social support (for example, lack of school lunch during school breaks), or shortage of full-service supermarkets. Food insecurity is associated with increased obesity, asthma, COPD, and cancer(ODPHP, 2020).</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Smoking</emphasis>—Include status as a current smoker, having ever smoked, the age when the client started, and the number of cigarettes smoked daily. This should be recorded as <term id="term-00048">pack-years</term>, calculated as the number of packs smoked per day multiplied by number of years smoked. The nurse should also assess for use of chewing tobacco, hookah smoking, and vaping, including the product the client uses, such as nicotine or tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). For pediatric clients, any exposure to smokers should document relationship, frequency, location (home, car, or other) and duration of smoke exposure. According to the CDC (2022a), <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00049">smoking</term> is the leading cause of preventable death and is associated with increased risk for asthma, COPD, and immune-system damage or dysfunction. It is the primary cause of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00050">lung cancer</term>, with 9 out of 10 lung cancer deaths caused by smoking or secondhand smoke exposure.</item>
<item><term id="term-00051">Alcohol intake</term>—Include the number of drinks in 1 sitting/day and the cumulative total per week. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) (2022b) recommends that women have no more than 1 drink per day and that men have no more than 2 drinks per day; they further define binge drinking as consumption of 4 or more drinks during a single event for women and 5 or more during a single event for men. Alcohol misuse affects the respiratory system and increases the incidence and associated risks of asthma, COPD, lung infection, aspiration pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Arvers, 2018).</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Illegal drug use</emphasis>—Include questions regarding any substance the client inhales, snorts, chews (edibles), or injects. This includes paint, markers, bleach, cleaning supplies, marijuana, cocaine, opioids (heroin and fentanyl), methamphetamines, gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), hallucinogens (ketamine, LSD, PCP, magic mushrooms), MDMA (ecstasy and Molly), and flunitrazepam (Rohypnol). Impact of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00052">drug use</term> on the respiratory system involves respiratory sedation, risk of respiratory arrest, and immune-system suppression, increasing the potential for respiratory infections (Plein &amp; Rittner, 2018).</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Prescription medications</emphasis>—Document the medication name, dose, frequency, and compliance; this will include medications taken for breathing problems and all other conditions. The nurse should be aware that clients may need prompting for the inclusion of medical cannabis in their medication list, as the number of states allowing for medical prescribing is increasing. Also assess the use of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00053">over-the-counter medications</term> and herbal remedies. Certain medications may affect the respiratory system. For example, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00054">angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors</term> to treat hypertension may cause a dry nighttime cough. Aspirin and other <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00055">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</term> induce bronchospasm and should be avoided in clients with a history of sensitivity to these medications.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Travel, geographic location, and environmental exposure</emphasis>—Assess to reveal exposure to diseases and pathogens found in certain areas that increase the risk for infection. Environmental exposures such as forest fires, pollution (often more common in lower socioeconomic or dense urban areas), gasoline fumes, or aerosolized chemicals (i.e., chlorine) increase upper and lower respiratory tract irritation and may worsen chronic respiratory conditions (Lee et al., 2021). Residential conditions influence the health of individuals; for example, substandard housing materials and overcrowding, along with biologic (molds, mites, roaches), chemical (lead, carbon monoxide), and physical (temperature, fine particles) hazards lead to respiratory disease (OASH, 2020). The nurse should document type of housing (single-family home, apartment, mobile home), setting (rural, suburban, urban), number of occupants, number of bedrooms, and any hazards or contributors to disease.</item>

<para id="para-00014">When conducting an assessment, the nurse should obtain a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00058">family history</term> of respiratory disorders.

Examples include:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00015">
<item>Cough—A potential sign of lung disease. Questions that the nurse might ask include: Is it the same, better, or worse than when it started? Is the cough dry or does it produce sputum? Does anyone else you spend time with have a cough?</item>
<item><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00063">Sputum</term>—A large cue in the respiratory assessment. The nurse should note the color, consistency, and amount. The nurse should also ask about a time of day when coughing is more prevalent (in the morning, during or after meals, etc.). Sputum can indicate infection, pulmonary edema, or cancer.</item>
<item>Wheezing—A sign of airway restriction. Does it occur with exercise or activity, or also at rest? Do you hear it while breathing in, breathing out, or both?</item>
<item>Shortness of breath—May indicate different types of lung problems. The nurse should note <term id="term-00064">dyspnea</term>, difficulty breathing, or <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00065">breathlessness</term>. Another factor that should be determined is <term id="term-00066">orthopnea</term>, shortness of breath that occurs when lying down and is relieved by sitting up. These findings often occur with chronic lung disease.</item>
</list>
<para id="para-00017">To assess further, the nurse should ask if the complaint or problem has ever occurred before, if there are known triggers, and what treatments have been used to make it better (Dezube, 2023).</para>

<title>Assessing Airway Sounds</title>
<para id="para-00024">If the client is having difficulty breathing with secretions present in the upper airway, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00083">respirations</term> would be loud and gurgling. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00084">Secretions</term> may be present due to infection, allergies, or other issues. The nurse should instruct the client to clear their throat before proceeding with the assessment.</para>
</note>
<para id="para-00025">With inspection of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00085">thorax</term>, the nurse should visually observe the rate, rhythm, depth of inspiration, and symmetry of the chest. The adult <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00086">respiratory rate</term> at rest is 12–16 breaths per minute (Dezube, 2023). The nurse should also note the type of breathing, intercostal retractions, and the use of accessory muscles. Also, the nurse should observe the comparison of lateral or transverse diameter to anteroposterior diameter; the normal ratio is 2:1. These cues indicate lung disease such as COPD and advanced aging.</para>
<para id="para-00026">With <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00087">palpation</term>, the nurse should examine by touch and note for any abnormalities found, such as tenderness or swelling. The nurse might note <term id="term-00088">crepitus</term> (air trapped in and under the skin), which is typically felt as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00089">crackling</term>. This should be reported to the health care provider. The nurse should also note <term id="term-00090">fremitus</term> (a vibration in the chest wall as the client speaks) during palpation.</para>
<para id="para-00027"><term id="term-00091">Percussion</term> is systematic tapping over the intercostal spaces, moving through the anterior, lateral, and posterior thorax.

<para id="para-00028">With <term id="term-00094">auscultation</term>, the nurse should listen with a stethoscope for normal breath sounds, abnormal sounds, and voice sounds. These sounds provide information about the flow of air through the lungs and trachea, which help to identify fluid, mucus, or obstruction in the respiratory system (Dezube, 2023). <link target-id="fig-00003" document="m00058"/> shows the proper sequence for auscultation.

<title>Psychosocial Assessment</title>
<para id="para-00030">A <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00096">psychosocial assessment</term> is important to determine how the client is coping with respiratory distress, either acute or chronic. The client’s emotions and responses may be based on concerns for normalcy, fitting in, bullying, cost of medications and health care, missed time from work or school, access to and cost of proper nutrition, safety, and support systems. In addition, the physical manifestations of disease may cause psychosocial symptom manifestation. A client with a high fever may be disorientated, a client with COPD may be depressed due to lack of cure, or a client with breathing difficulty may have <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00097">anxiety</term> caused by the sensation of not getting enough air.</para>
<para id="para-00031">The nurse should encourage clients to express their feelings and fears, allowing the health care provider to address their anxiety, depression, stress, or other concerns. The nurse should discuss coping mechanisms to enable the client to better handle the emotions and promote optimum disease and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00098">symptom management</term>. The nurse may educate the client on <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00099">coping mechanisms</term> such as deep breathing, relaxation, and other techniques that decrease anxiety. Referrals to social, financial, educational, occupational, or mental health resources may be appropriate.</para>

<para id="para-00033">The imaging assessment should include a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00162">chest x-ray</term> and possibly a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00163">computed tomography (CT)</term> scan. Chest x-ray is used to evaluate and assess the lungs. The x-ray may detect pneumonia, atelectasis, pneumothorax, and a tumor. If further evaluation is needed, a CT can be ordered, used in cases where suspicious lesions or clots are thought to be present. The CT will verify these findings.</para>
<para id="para-00034">Pulse oximetry, capnography, and pulmonary function tests are noninvasive tests that provide information about gas exchange in the client (Wood, 2022). <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00164">Pulse oximetry</term> identifies hemoglobin saturation with oxygen; the range should be 95–100%. A range below 91% in a client with no chronic respiratory problems is an emergency. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00165">capnography</term> measures carbon dioxide, and the pulmonary function test assesses breathing problems and lung function; they are utilized in both diagnosis and management of COPD and asthma.</para>

<title>Analysis of Nutrition and the Pulmonary System</title>
<para id="para-00035">With a complete pulmonary assessment, the provider must note any abnormal cues and analyze these findings. The abnormal findings typically are related to nutritional requirements and deficits. Depending on the indications from the initial 24-hour food recall, follow-up or repeated assessments would assist in determining any repeated calorie excesses or deficits. A focus on types of food intake, portions, meal patterns, and knowledge of nutrient content provide the initial clues for the physical exam findings that may be present in clients with pulmonary conditions.</para>
<para id="para-00036">A cursory consideration of weight and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00166">BMI</term> may not be the best indication of the nutritional status and overall health for a client. In fact, a low BMI is linked to increased mortality for <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00167">COPD</term> clients due to the physiologic consequences of diaphragmatic weakness, decreased lung function, and systemic inflammation (McDonald et al., 2019). <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00168">Malnutrition</term> may result in clients with COPD or other chronic diseases from their increased energy expenditures, causing fatigue, less activity, muscle loss, and poor appetite. Weight loss can worsen with each exacerbation (McDonald et al., 2019). Diminished <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00169">muscle mas</term> is a sign of exercise intolerance and sedentary lifestyle for clients with chronic pulmonary disease. Malnutrition is a negative factor in the prognosis of COPD.</para>
<para id="para-00037">Obesity is a well-established health factor, recognized by the World Health Organization (2023) as a leading public health issue, with estimates in the 2016 data that 41 million children under age 5 and 240 million children ages 5–19 are <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00170">overweight</term> or obese. These children typically remain overweight or obese in adulthood. Obesity is a factor for increased <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00171">asthma</term> risk through its role in inflammation and pulmonary overreaction to environmental triggers (Calcaterra et al., 2021). Obesity alters the mechanics of the pulmonary system, leading to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00172">dyspnea</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00173">wheezing</term>, and airway hyperresponsiveness (Dixon &amp; Peters, 2018). Excessive weight reduces pulmonary and chest wall compliance, contributing to increased work of breathing in adults and children, but the inflammatory immunomodulatory impact of high-fat, high-sugar, and low-nutrient “Western” diets is the predominant <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00174">obesity</term> impact in children with asthma (Calcaterra et al., 2021). These physiologic responses are exacerbated by the low activity levels that are a natural consequence of pulmonary symptoms.</para>
