<para id="para-00002">The preschool, school-age, and adolescent population includes children aged 4 to 17. Health promotion and disease prevention are important for children in this age range as this is a crucial period of growth and development when children form habits and behaviors that will impact their health and well-being throughout their lives. Children who learn healthy habits early are more likely to continue them into adulthood. Many chronic diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, and obesity, begin in childhood. Helping children develop these healthy habits and behaviors may reduce their risk of such diseases occurring. Children are also building strong bones and muscles, which will reduce their risk of injury as they age. Finally, children in this age group are developing the social and emotional skills they will take into adulthood. For example, children build self-esteem and confidence by participating in physical activity such as sports. Learning good hygiene practices can help build <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">social skills</term> and respect for others (National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 2022b).</para>

<para id="para-00004"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">Immunization rates</term> are also important data to review concerning child and adolescent health. Rates for certain vaccinations (measles, mumps, and rubella; varicella; diphtheria; tetanus; and acellular pertussis) decreased by 1 percent from the 2020–2021 school year to the 2021–2022 school year in incoming kindergarteners (Seither et al., 2022). Also, 2.6 percent of the 2021–2022 kindergarteners were exempted from at least one state-required vaccination per their caregivers’ requests.</para>

</note>
<para id="para-00007">Global health data regarding immunizations is not promising. Immunization rates, in particular, are somewhat difficult to gauge beyond the toddler years. A 2022 systematic review confirmed a worldwide decline or delay in vaccination during the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">COVID-19</term> pandemic (SeyedAlinaghi et al., 2022). This follows indications that 13.5 million children were not vaccinated in 2018 (Vanderslott et al., 2022). Although there has been a global decline in v<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">accine-preventable diseases (VPDs)</term>, they are still responsible for 1.5 million deaths annually. Ninety-two percent of people worldwide thought that vaccines were important for children to have, but support for vaccination varies among countries (Vanderslott et al., 2022). This is described further in <link document="m00167">Pandemics and Infectious Disease Outbreaks</link>.</para>
<para id="para-00008">Globally, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">obesity</term> in children aged 5 to 19 is considered a major health concern as it is a significant risk factor for many noncommunicable diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and some cancers (endometrial, breast, ovarian, prostate, liver, gallbladder, kidney, and colon) as well as for musculoskeletal disorders. In 2016, the WHO reported that the share of those aged 5 to 19 who are overweight or obese has increased from 4 percent in 1975 to around 18 percent in 2016. Also in 2016, over 340 million children and adolescents aged 5 to 19 were overweight or obese, while 39 million children under age 5 were overweight or obese in 2020 (WHO, 2021).</para>

<para id="para-00009">Once considered a high-income country problem, overweight and obesity are now increasing in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in urban areas. For example, “in Africa, the number of overweight children under age 5 has increased by nearly 24 percent since 2000, and almost half of the children under age 5 who were overweight or obese in 2019 lived in Asia” (WHO, 2021, para. 7). These low- and middle-income countries are now facing what the WHO refers to as a “double burden” of malnutrition. Children in these countries are more vulnerable to inadequate nutrition prenatally and as newborns and infants, and then they get introduced to “high-fat, high-sugar, high-salt, energy-dense, and micronutrient-poor foods, which tend to be lower in cost” (WHO, 2021, para. 12). This is illustrated in the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific video “Addressing Childhood Obesity Today to Protect the Health of Future Generations.”</para>

<para id="para-00012">In 2020, the global mortality rate for those aged 5 to 14 was 7 per 1,000 children. Infectious diseases have declined in the last decade, but injuries (including road traffic injuries and drowning) remain the leading causes of death and lifelong disability in this age group (WHO, 2022b). In those aged 15 to 19, the probability of dying is 4.6 per 1,000 (World Bank Group, 2023a). Again, there is a shift away from infectious diseases of childhood and toward accidents and injuries, self-harm, and interpersonal violence as the leading causes of death (WHO, 2022b, 2022c).</para>

<caption>Risk Factors Influencing Health (See Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021a, 2021b, 2021c, 2021d, 2021e.)</caption>
</table>
<para id="para-00014">Environmental and social risk factors can have long-lasting effects on the health and development of this population (National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences [NIEHS], 2023). See <link document="m00140">Social Determinants Affecting Health Outcomes</link> for more information. Physical or biological risk factors can also influence the health of the preschool, school-age, and adolescent population (Negussie et al., 2019). The same prenatal and perinatal factors and genetic factors mentioned previously can continue to affect children as they age. Any developmental delays or disabilities continue to impact cognitive, physical, and socio-emotional development. Infections and communicable diseases can adversely affect physical health acutely and can also lead to long-term health problems. Allergies and asthma have negative effects on respiratory health and quality of life. Other chronic health conditions have long-term health and development consequences. These may include diseases such as diabetes or congenital heart defects. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">Nutritional deficiencies</term> or imbalances, including obesity, can impact growth, development, and overall health. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">Sleep disturbances</term> may negatively influence cognitive and behavioral development (Negussie et al., 2019). <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">Hormonal changes</term> during puberty can impact physical, cognitive, and emotional development.</para>
<para id="para-00015"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">Lifestyle-related risk factors</term> may play a huge role in a child’s risk of developing some conditions, such as childhood cancers, ADHD, and asthma (American Cancer Society, 2019; Cleveland Clinic, 2023a; Mayo Clinic, 2019). As mentioned, childhood cancers are a leading cause of death for preschool and school-age children. Cancer prevention can begin prenatally and continue through early childhood. In addition to getting enough folic acid, avoiding alcohol and tobacco use prenatally, and breastfeeding postpartum, childbearing clients may lower a child’s cancer risk through other behaviors (CDC, 2021k). Safe, stable, and nurturing relationships and environments can help protect children against many harms and ensure they reach their full potential. This includes keeping children away from exposures to secondhand smoke, traffic-related air pollution, carcinogens, and excessive radiation used during medical tests. However, many childhood cancers cannot be prevented (American Cancer Society, 2019).</para>
<para id="para-00016"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">ADHD</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">asthma</term> are other common health concerns in this population. While there is no known cause for ADHD, prevention efforts involve addressing maternal substance use and misuse, premature birth, and exposure to environmental toxins (Mayo Clinic, 2019). Researchers have not determined the exact cause of childhood asthma, which often develops when the child’s immune system is developing (Cleveland Clinic, 2023a). Asthma may have genetic components, and exposure to allergens, such as tobacco smoke, and viral infections, such as the common cold, at an early age have also been associated with its development in children (Cleveland Clinic, 2023a). Gender, racial, and geographic disparities also exist, with males, BIPOC children, and children who live in urban environments or around high amounts of air pollution at higher risk of developing asthma (Cleveland Clinic, 2023a).</para>
<para id="para-00017">Poor mental health can be a risk factor for substance misuse, sexual health issues, and suicide. Suicide is the second most common cause of death in those aged 10 to 14 years and the third most common cause of death in those aged 15 to 24 years (CDC, 2022r). Many factors can increase the risk for suicide or protect against it (<link target-id="table-00003" document="m00323"/>). It is often connected to other forms of injury or violence. Those who have experienced violence such as child abuse, bullying, or sexual violence have a higher risk for a suicide attempt.</para>

<para id="para-00018">Adolescent girls and adolescents identifying as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">LGBTQIA+</term> experience high levels of violence, sadness, mental health challenges, and suicide risk (CDC, 2023k).

<para id="para-00019">Another area of health risk for this population is <term id="term-00014">concussion</term> or brain injury. Anyone in this population who obtains a bump, blow, or jolt to the head or hit to the body that causes the head and brain to move rapidly back and forth could suffer a concussion, with youth athletes particularly at risk (CDC, 2022b). School and community health nurses may educate youth athletes, caregivers, coaches, and officials in preventing concussions, recognizing their signs and consequences, and identifying a safe return to activity following a concussion.</para>
<para id="para-00020">Risk factors for adolescents related to sexual health include activities that can lead to adverse health outcomes such as HIV infection, other STIs, or pregnancy. <term id="term-00015">Sexual risk behavior</term> is any behavior—typically condom-unprotected oral, vaginal, or anal intercourse—that puts one at risk for these adverse health outcomes (Senn, 2020).</para>
<para id="para-00021">Recognizing these many risk factors that can adversely impact this population’s health and well-being is the first step in promoting health. Children and adolescents from marginalized or disadvantaged backgrounds may be at higher risk for experiencing risk factors. The HEADSS (Home, Education, Activities, Drug use and abuse, Sexual behavior, Suicidality, and depression) for Adolescents tool is a psychosocial risk assessment instrument that health care professionals may find useful in finding out about issues in adolescents’ lives (Cohen et al., 1991).</para>

<para id="para-00023">School nurses and school health programs are ideal for health promotion and disease prevention for this population, as described in <link document="m00338">Caring Across Practice Settings</link>. Schools have direct contact with 56 million students for at least six hours daily during the most critical years of their development (CDC, 2020c). School health programs can decrease the prevalence of health risk behaviors by delivering quality sexual health education; increasing youth access to sexual health services; establishing healthy, safe, and supportive environments to promote positive mental health; and implementing policies that provide health promotion and disease prevention (CDC, 2020c).</para>

<para id="para-00027">The overarching goal of Healthy People 2030 related to adolescents is to “improve the health and well-being of adolescents” (ODPHP, n.d.-a, para. 1). Improving adolescent health can prevent some behaviors that can affect health later in life. Adolescents have many risk factors, many of which are preventable, including <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">substance use disorders</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020">STIs</term>, and injuries from motor vehicle accidents. The physical and mental changes occurring during adolescence can also impact their safety and health. Encouragement of positive health behaviors is essential in this population. Therefore, there are many Healthy People 2030 objectives geared toward adolescents.</para>

<title>Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Activities to Improve the Health of Preschool, School-Age, and Adolescent Populations</title>
<para id="para-00030">Improving the health of this population is an important public health goal. Health promotion activities, such as the education previously described, can play a crucial role in achieving this goal. Nurses can promote positive health outcomes by enabling this population to increase control over their health and its determinants as they age. Activities can include various interventions to promote healthy behaviors, prevent diseases and injuries, and improve health care access and may occur in various settings, including schools, health care facilities, community centers, and homes. Examples include education and awareness campaigns, nutrition and physical activity interventions, mental health interventions, and health care access initiatives. By implementing these interventions, nurses can help promote healthy behaviors and improve children’s and adolescents' overall health and well-being.</para>
<para id="para-00031">The CDC (2021a, 2021b, 2021d, 2021e) website provides information for caregivers of <link url="https://openstax.org/r/cdcchildren">children ages 4 to 11</link> and for <link url="https://openstax.org/r/teens">teens</link>. These pages discuss the topics in greater detail and provide specific schedules for growth charts and immunizations.</para>
<para id="para-00032">Disease prevention promotes healthy growth and development by supporting children’s and adolescents’ physical and cognitive growth and development. By protecting this population from illnesses, the nurse can help them reach their full potential (ODPHP, n.d.-a). Preventing diseases also helps reduce health care costs through a lesser need for medical treatment or hospitalizations. Healthy children and adolescents are more likely to have good academic performance with less absenteeism, positively influencing their academic lives and contributing to their future professional lives. By preventing certain diseases, nurses help to protect this population’s long-term health and the wider community by reducing the spread of infectious diseases (ODPHP, n.d.-a).</para>
<para id="para-00033">Because some of the most common preventable diseases affecting this population include COVID-19, influenza, and obesity, health promotion and applicable prevention efforts should target them. Preventing accidents, homicides, and suicides is also imperative for this population. School-age children must also combat other infectious diseases, most notably chicken pox. Adolescents and their caregivers should receive preventive services related to anxiety and depression, substance misuse, violence, blood clots, cervical cancer, and STDs (CDC, 2021d).</para>

<title>Integration of Sociocultural and Linguistically Responsive Interventions for Preschool, School-Age, and Adolescent Health</title>
<para id="para-00043">Promoting the health and well-being of this population requires consideration of sociocultural factors, such as race, ethnicity, culture, and language. Various challenges and considerations are involved in implementing sociocultural and linguistically responsive interventions in this population. This section provides examples of successful programs that effectively integrate responsiveness into health interventions. Nurses can improve health outcomes and reduce health disparities for children and adolescents from diverse backgrounds through integrations such as these.</para>
<para id="para-00044">Caregivers who identify as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">BIPOC</term> are less likely than non-Hispanic White parents to report their children receive high-quality health care. Examples of structural inequities these clients experience include <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00025">racism</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00026">xenophobia</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00027">poverty</term>. Okoniweski et al. (2022) reported that children whose caregivers’ primary language is not English face additional disparities and are less likely to have a regular source of medical care. These indications strengthen the need for sociocultural and linguistic interventions to promote better pediatric outcomes.</para>
<section id="sect-00012">
<title>Sociocultural Interventions</title>
<para id="para-00045">The cigarette smoking rate among <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">Alaska Native</term> adults was 36 percent from 2018 to 2020 (Alaska Department of Health, 2022). This provides Alaska with a unique challenge to protect children from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke exposure. The Alaska Tobacco Prevention and Control Program (TPC) has promoted smoke-free environments through various interventions geared toward the Alaska Native population. The Alaska Tobacco Quit Line provides resources for tobacco cessation. TPC has partnered with the American Lung Association and the Alaska Tobacco Control Alliance to promote smoke-free unit housing and promote policies to prohibit the use of tobacco products on school properties (ODPHP, 2021). Additional partnerships have occurred between TPC and the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium to coordinate outreach efforts in rural communities, where as many as 4 in 10 adults smoke (ODPHP, 2021). Rural community health workers, who may reach citizens via boat or snowmobile, provide adults with tobacco cessation education and describe the hazards of secondhand smoke in children.</para>
<para id="para-00046">The CDC’s (2023f) <link url="https://openstax.org/r/whatworks">What Works in Schools</link> program is a school-based health approach to improve health behaviors and experiences, support mental health, and reduce suicidality. Children and adolescents who identify as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029">LGBTQIA+</term> are particularly at risk for facing social stigma about their sexual choices or identities, which places their health at risk. Some specific interventions identified by this CDC program to help this population are establishing gender and sexuality alliances (GSA), identifying safe spaces, and implementing anti-harassment policies (CDC, 2023f).</para>
</section>
<section id="sect-00013">
<title>Linguistically Responsive Interventions</title>
<para id="para-00047">The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released an updated framework to advance health equity, expand health coverage, and improve health outcomes for people covered by Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and the health insurance marketplaces. This framework identified the need to advance language access and health literacy and provide culturally tailored services to all groups. In particular, one priority in the CMS Framework for Health Equity 2022–2032 states, “Each person CMS serves should receive effective, understandable, and respectful care that is responsive to their preferred languages or dialects, health literacy, cultural health beliefs and practices, traditions, and other communication needs” (CMS, 2022, p. 25). The government’s dedication to being linguistically responsive can also be seen regarding child and youth behavioral health crisis care. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s (SAMHSA, 2022) National Guidelines for Child and Youth Behavioral Health Crisis Care also requires incorporating linguistically responsive care as one of its core values for youth crisis care. This includes care regarding LGBTQIA+ youth who may be unable to access the mental health care they need to prevent suicide (SAMHSA, 2022).</para>
<para id="para-00048">Nurses may use several interventions to overcome language barriers with clients who do not speak English. These typically involve in-person interpreters or interpreter services via telephone. Jackson and Mixer (2017) described the difficulty Spanish-speaking caregivers of clients in acute care experienced and proposed using the UTalk app on an Apple iPad as a solution. The app’s interface design included a split-screen layout with an English statement on one side of the device (facing the nurse) and the same statement in Spanish flipped 180° on the other side of the screen (facing the Spanish-speaking client or family member). The app included many statements or closed-ended questions that could be used for basic communication such as “The interpreter has been called,” “Do you need anything to eat?” and “Are you having any pain?” Participants using the app reported facilitation of communication. They indicated that teaching the caregivers and clients how to use the app was an icebreaker and that it helped nurses develop relationships with the families (Jackson &amp; Mixer, 2017).</para>

<title>Chapter Summary</title>
<para id="para-00049">Promoting health and preventing disease in children from preschool through adolescents is necessary for their lifelong well-being. Clients in this age group form habits and behaviors during this time frame that will impact their health for years. By fostering healthy habits and behaviors during these formative years, nurses can help establish a foundation of health for the rest of these children’s lives. Prevention strategies include immunization and education to empower this population to make informed decisions about every aspect of their health. Using health promotion and disease prevention, this age group can develop healthy lifestyles and reduce their risk of developing chronic diseases.</para>
