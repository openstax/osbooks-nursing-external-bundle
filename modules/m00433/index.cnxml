<para id="para-00001">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">renal system</term>, consisting of the kidneys, ureters, and urethra, has several essential functions (Ogobuiro &amp; Tuma, 2022). In addition to filtering and removing waste products from the body, it also regulates plasma osmolarity, acid-base balance, and blood pressure (BP). Accordingly, the renal system affects many cells and organs within the body. Acute kidney injury affects as many as 60% of all critically ill hospitalized clients (Pickkers et al., 2021). The ureters, bladder, and urethra are at risk from infection, obstruction, vascular compromise, and other conditions. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">Chronic renal disease</term>, often associated with hypertension and diabetes, affects one in seven adults, and 90% of those affected are unaware of their condition (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 2021).</para>
