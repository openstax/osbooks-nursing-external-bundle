<title>Genetic Hemochromatosis</title>
<para id="para-00006"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">Genetic hemochromatosis</term> causes excessive absorption of dietary iron secondary to decreased expression of the peptide hormone hepcidin. It is the most common autosomal recessive disorder in White individuals, affecting one in 300â€“500 people of northern European descent (Porter &amp; Prashanth, 2023). It is twice as common in males as females and can result in multiple organ dysfunction. Excessive intestinal dietary intake of heme and nonheme iron is primarily managed by dietary modifications (Milman, 2021). These modifications are extensive and require nutritional counseling and reinforcement by health care professionals:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00003">
<item>Consider a vegetarian or semivegetarian diet.</item>
<item>Consume 21 oz of fruit and vegetables daily; fresh is best.</item>
<item>Avoid red meat from mammals; instead, choose lean, white poultry.</item>
<item>Avoid processed meat. Consume no more than 7 oz of meat from poultry per week. Consider additional protein sources such as fish, eggs, and legumes.</item>

<title>Hemophilia</title>
<para id="para-00007"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">Hemophilia</term> is an inherited X-linked blood disorder resulting in decreased levels of clotting factor VIII or IX.

A recommended diet includes iron-rich foods such as lean red meat, leafy green vegetables, broccoli, dried beans, grains, and raisins. It is important to consume foods containing vitamin C, such as orange juice, to enhance iron absorption.</para>

<title>Impact of Cancer on Nutrition and Hematologic Function</title>
<para id="para-00009">Advanced age is a risk factor for nutritional deficiency; the addition of chronic diseases, including malignancy, can quickly lead to malnourishment. These comorbidities can contribute to reduced tolerance of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">anticancer therapy</term>, impacting survival (Stauder et al., 2020).</para>
<para id="para-00010">The prevalence of anemia in cancer can exceed 90% across all ages and is generally considered to be related to medications, infections, or disorders of hematopoiesis. Common concerns are alterations in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">activities of daily living</term> affecting quality of life, decreased productivity, and inability to work. Fatigue is reported as the most common troubling symptom of cancer and is directly linked to anemia (Gilreath &amp; Rodgers, 2020). <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">Fatigue</term> and lack of appetite commonly coexist, resulting in an inability to prepare meals, further exacerbating anemia.</para>
<para id="para-00011">Anemia was traditionally believed to be primarily related to the adverse effects of anticancer therapy; however, recent research has shown a direct correlation with chronic, low-grade inflammation. <term id="term-00017">Functional iron deficiency</term>, malnutrition, and anorexia contribute to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">cancer-associated anemia</term> (Natalucci et al., 2021). See <link target-id="table-00002" document="m00046"/> for types of IDA in cancer. In contrast, iron overload can occur in clients with symptomatic anemia receiving <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">red blood cell transfusions</term> and can alter the function of effective hematopoiesis, contributing to anemia (Gilreath &amp; Rodgers, 2020). Other micronutrient deficiencies affecting hematologic function in individuals with cancer include folate and vitamin B<sub>12</sub>.</para>
<para id="para-00012">Approximately 50% of adults with <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020">colon cancer</term> have anemia due to chronic blood loss from the gastrointestinal tract (Chardalias et al., 2023). The prevalence of anemia in other cancers ranges from 29% to 46%, mainly related to chronic disease, chemotherapy-induced anemia, nutrient-related anemia, chronic <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00021">anorexia</term>, and gastrointestinal adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (Busti et.al., 2018).</para>

<title>Nutritional Interventions</title>
<para id="para-00013">Chronic illness has a significant impact on nutrition and, consequently, hematologic wellness. Recommendations have evolved due to more emphasis on a holistic approach to caring for those with hemoglobinopathies and cancer.</para>
<para id="para-00014">The Mediterranean diet has gained popularity in the United States as a way to manage weight, lower cholesterol, and stabilize blood sugar. Close investigation of the constituents of this eating lifestyle reveals significant anti-inflammatory properties that translate well to chronic hematologic illness. Extra-virgin olive oil is has been found to block the proinflammatory cascade (Natalucci et al., 2021).</para>
<para id="para-00015">The following foods and substances rich in antioxidants contribute to anti-inflammatory and microbiota-modulating properties:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00004">
<item>Phytochemical vitamins in red, orange, and yellow fruits and dark green leafy vegetables</item>
<item>Ginger</item>
<item>Green tea</item>
<item>Garlic</item>
<item>Black pepper</item>
<item>Turmeric</item>
</list>
<para id="para-00016">To avoid severe nutritional deficiencies, a high-calorie, nutrient-rich diet is essential for people living with SCD and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00027">thalassemia</term>. Increased oral hydration is vital in SCD to decrease the frequency of painful vaso-occlusive events. Additional recommendations include daily supplements of omega-3 fatty acids, folic acid, high-dose vitamin D, and a multivitamin without iron. For clients with thalassemia specifically, drinking black tea may decrease the gastrointestinal absorption of iron (Goldberg et al., 2018; Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, 2020b; Srichairatanakool et al., 2020).</para>
<para id="para-00017">People with SCD and vitamin D deficiency consuming a diet rich in fish, milk, cheese, and eggs were found to have decreased hospital and emergency department visits (McCaskill et al., 2018). High-dose <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">vitamin D replacement</term> (greater than 3000 units per day) has been found to augment immune response and decrease the risk of respiratory infections in SCD (Umeakunne &amp; Hibbert, 2019). Recent literature strongly correlates that vitamin D and chronic inflammation play an important role in regulating iron homeostasis, which can improve anemia (Natalucci et al., 2021).</para>
<para id="para-00018">Adults living with hemoglobinopathies should avoid drinking alcohol because it potentiates the oxidative damage caused by iron overload (Milman, 2021).</para>
