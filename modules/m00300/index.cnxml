<media alt="In a five-part process, the nervous system relies on (1) stimulus (a half-full glass of water in this example), (2) a receptor (the eye, seeing the glass), (3) the control center (the brain), (4) an effector (an arm, lifting the glass), and (5) an effect (drinking from the glass) to create either homeostasis or imbalance. Imbalance is depicted as two beams on an axis, currently not at the same horizontal level."><image mime-type="image/jpeg" src="../../media/PHA_Unit02_04_05_001_Splash.jpg"/></media>

<para id="para-00001">Maintaining a healthy balance of fluids, electrolytes, vitamins, and minerals is a crucial aspect of a person’s overall well-being. Traditional pharmacological interventions are often used to manage imbalances in these areas. However, alternative therapies may also offer potential benefits to relieving symptoms and conditions caused by an imbalance in these areas. Understanding the role of fluids and electrolytes, as well as the potential uses and limitations of alternative therapies, is important for health care providers seeking to optimize their clients’ health and well-being.</para>
