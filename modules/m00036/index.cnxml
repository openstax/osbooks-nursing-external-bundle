    <title>Pregnancy</title>
    <para id="para-00002">A cascade of endocrine-related changes occurs during <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">pregnancy</term>. Many of these physiologic changes occur in the endocrine system (<link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00036"/>) to prepare the pregnant individual for fetal growth and bodily changes during pregnancy. The placenta drives these changes by producing <term id="term-00002">human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG)</term> (Kepley et al., 2023). This hormone stimulates the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">corpus luteum</term> to produce the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">progesterone</term> necessary for growing and maintaining a fetus, and it changes the pregnant individual’s immune function to protect the fetus from immune rejection. HCG also stimulates the ovaries to increase <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">estrogen</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">progesterone</term> production until weeks 10–12 of pregnancy, when the maturation of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">placenta</term> is complete (Herrick &amp; Bordoni, 2023). The placenta then takes over the production of those hormones throughout the pregnancy. In addition, the pregnant individual’s <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">hypothalamus</term> creates and releases <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)</term> to stimulate thyroid-stimulating hormone and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">prolactin</term> from the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">pituitary gland</term> (sometimes called the master gland).</para>

    <para id="para-00003">The placenta increases TRH, thus stimulating the pituitary gland, which then increases <term id="term-00012">thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)</term>, a hormone that triggers secretion of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland. Thyroid hormone production increases by 50% throughout pregnancy (Singh &amp; Sandu, 2023). These hormones include <term id="term-00013">triiodothyronine (T3)</term> and <term id="term-00014">thyroxine (T4)</term>, which regulate weight, energy levels, and metabolism. The influx of thyroid hormones is required for fetal <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">brain development</term> and thyroid function (Kepley et al., 2023). The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">parathyroid gland</term> (<link target-id="fig-00002" document="m00036"/>) secretes <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">parathyroid hormone (PTH)</term> to generate and maintain sufficient calcium levels for fetal growth (Hysaj et al., 2021). PTH allows adequate calcium absorption during pregnancy by maintaining ionized blood calcium phosphate levels by monitoring extracellular <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">calcium concentrations</term> (a lower calcium concentration triggers the release of PTH). Other functions of PTH include conserving calcium, decreasing phosphate reabsorption, and stimulating vitamin D production needed for the intestinal absorption of calcium. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">Vitamin D deficiency</term> in pregnant clients is associated with elevated PTH levels (Hysaj et al., 2021). PTH concentration during the first trimester is in the lower normal range, but during the pregnancy, PTH levels increase to reach mid-normal range by the third trimester (Hysaj et al., 2021). The pituitary gland increases by approximately 136% because of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020">lactotroph hyperplasia</term>, which results in an influx of prolactin (Nana &amp; Williamson, 2022). <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00021">Prolactin</term> levels increase by 10 times during pregnancy to promote <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00022">breast tissue development</term> for later milk production.</para>
    <para id="para-00004">The corpus luteum and placenta release a peptide called <term id="term-00023">relaxin</term>, which affects the connective tissue in the body. It has several effects in pregnancy (Kepley et al., 2023). Relaxin softens the birth canal, supports growth of mammary glands, and prevents premature uterine contractions. Relaxin also facilitates the release of nitric oxide, which promotes systemic vasodilation resulting in decreased maternal <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00024">blood pressure</term>. In addition to the changes caused by relaxin, cortisol levels increase during pregnancy, which is vital for <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00025">fetal brain development</term> (Kepley et al., 2023). However, excessively elevated <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00026">glucocorticoid levels</term> impair <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00027">neurodevelopment</term> in the fetus. To combat pain during labor, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">endorphin</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029">enkephalin</term> levels increase.</para>

    <title>Impact of Nutrition on the Endocrine System During Pregnancy</title>
    <para id="para-00005">Nutrition during pregnancy is vital for the health of both the pregnant client and the fetus. Normal hormonal changes cause disruptions in the pregnant individual’s body, and nutritional requirements change throughout the pregnancy with the need to support the nutrition of both the client and the fetus. A balanced diet, micronutrients, and intake of omega-3 fatty acids promote a healthy pregnancy during hormonal changes. To prevent a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00030">vitamin D deficiency</term>, the National Institutes of Health (2022c) recommends a daily intake of 15 mcg during pregnancy and lactation.</para>
    <para id="para-00006">Pregnancy requires proper nutrient-rich foods to support optimal endocrine function and ensure the health of both the pregnant client and the fetus (Jouanne et al., 2021). The pregnant client needs <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00031">carbohydrates</term> to fuel the increased energy demands of the growing fetus (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2020). These carbohydrates support proper hormone production, including insulin, which regulates blood glucose levels. The growing fetus needs adequate <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00032">protein</term> to develop and to produce hormones. Healthy fats play a role in hormone synthesis, fetal development, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00033">absorption</term> of fat-soluble vitamins (Jouanne et al., 2021). <link target-id="table-00001" document="m00036"/> lists macronutrient intake ranges for the pregnant client.

    <title>Pregnancy Complications: Hyperemesis Gravidarum</title>
    <para id="para-00007">Some pregnant clients experience <term id="term-00034">hyperemesis gravidarum</term>, a condition during pregnancy characterized by extreme, persistent <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00035">nausea</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00036">vomiting</term>. Although the exact cause is unknown, genetic predisposition and hormonal and gastrointestinal changes may play a part. The hormonal change theory involves the dramatic increase in HCG because some correlational studies show elevations in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00037">HCG</term> with hyperemesis gravidarum. Estrogen is also believed to be a contributing factor. As <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00038">estrogen levels</term> rapidly increase, so does vomiting. Estrogen-containing medications are known to cause nausea and vomiting as a side effect, which supports this theory. Lower esophageal sphincter relaxation during pregnancy is the basis for the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00039">gastrointestinal change theory</term>. Even though the basis for this theory is structural, hormones still play a role. It is theorized that the increased levels of progesterone and relaxin hormones circulating in the bloodstream contribute to the relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter. The lower esophageal sphincter closes to prevent acid from traveling back up the esophagus, as occurs during <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00040">acid reflux</term>. However, the relaxin hormone limits the functionality of the esophageal sphincter, contributing to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00041">heartburn</term>.</para>
    <para id="para-00008">Hyperemesis gravidarum complicates pregnancy because it can prevent the client and fetus from absorbing vital nutrients. Nutritional recommendations for a client with hyperemesis gravidarum include switching the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00042">prenatal vitamins</term> to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00043">folic acid supplements</term> only and the inclusion of a ginger supplement. There is limited research on diets changes that can minimize nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. One correlational study found fewer symptoms among women who consumed vegetables, fruits, and beans or legumes. However, women with elevated HCG levels in the same study who consumed increased amounts of processed white bread had a higher incidence of hyperemesis gravidarum (Tan et al., 2021).</para>

    <title>Pregnancy Complications: Gestational Diabetes</title>
    <para id="para-00009">Pregnant clients may have preexisting diabetes (either type 1 or type 2) or may develop diabetes during pregnancy, which is known as <term id="term-00044">gestational diabetes</term> (GD). GD is a disorder that occurs as the result of changes caused by human placental lactogen, a hormone that helps regulate insulin secretion, which leads to dysfunction or delayed response of the beta cells to blood glucose, thereby producing <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00045">glucose intolerance</term> (Quintanilla Rodriguez &amp; Mahdy, 2022; Rasmussen et al., 2020). Other hormones associated with GD include <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00046">corticotropin-releasing hormone</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00047">progesterone</term> because these hormones are associated with insulin resistance and elevated <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00048">blood glucose levels</term>. These changes typically occur around the 24th to 28th week of pregnancy, with some individuals having complete resolution after childbirth. However, clients who experience GD have an increased risk for <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00049">type 2 diabetes</term> later in life.</para>
    <para id="para-00010">Risk factors for GD include obesity, family history, a history of GD with previous pregnancy, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00050">polycystic ovary syndrome</term>, and high-risk race or ethnicity (Quintanilla Rodriguez &amp; Mahdy, 2022). A recent study of live births in the U.S. found that the rates of gestational diabetes among pregnant women with their first live birth increased across all race and ethnicity groups between 2011 and 2019 (Shah et al, 2021). However, rates were significantly higher among most non-Hispanic Asian and Hispanic/Latina subgroups compared to non-Hispanic White individuals.</para>
    <note class="special-considerations" id="note-00001">
    <title>Greater Risk for Gestational Diabetes</title>
    <para id="para-00011">In the U.S., American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) women have higher rates of GD compared to non-Hispanic white women (Stotz et al., 2021). A recent study found AI/AN women were aware of the role of nutrition for maintaining a healthy weight during pregnancy and decreasing the risk for type 2 diabetes, but they were not aware that these principles could be applied to reduce their risk for GD. These findings highlight the need for culturally relevant diet instruction and interventions to address this disparity.</para>
    </note>
    <para id="para-00012">Nutritional considerations are the main factors for glucose control (Rasmussen et al., 2020). Pregnant clients with GD should receive recommendations from their obstetrician and counseling from a registered dietitian and diabetes expert. The nurse maintains sacred relationships with their clients, and this opportunity gives the nurse an advantage in educating them on the correct micronutrient and macronutrient consumption before diabetes counseling occurs. Many clients believe that blood glucose is solely related to sugar consumption and do not understand that the body breaks down carbohydrates to glucose, thus affecting blood glucose levels (Chen et al., 2020; Rasmussen et al., 2020). In addition, when individuals consume insufficient carbohydrates and increase their fat intake, they can develop elevated levels of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00051">serum fatty acids</term>. This increase in serum fatty acids results in increased <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00052">insulin resistance</term> as well as higher than expected fetal fat accumulation and infant <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00053">adiposity</term> (Rasmussen et al., 2020).</para>
    <para id="para-00013">Low-glycemic, high-fiber foods such as vegetables, legumes, nuts, fruits, and whole grains are recommended (Rasmussen et al., 2020). Other healthy diet options include lean proteins such as chicken, turkey, and salmon (which contains omega-3 fatty acids) and healthy fats such as avocados and nuts. Pregnant clients also need to consider portion control when consuming carbohydrates. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00054">California MyPlate for Gestational Diabetes</term> provides a visual example of recommendations for the pregnant client (California Department of Public Health, 2018). Pregnant clients should consume the recommended amounts of folic acid, vitamin D, iron, and calcium. Currently, there is no evidence to suggest that taking additional amounts of these micronutrients affects GD (Rasmussen et al., 2020).</para>
    <para id="para-00014">The <term id="term-00055">glycemic index</term> is a system that ranks carbohydrate-containing foods based on their ability to raise blood sugar levels quickly or significantly (Rasmussen et al., 2020). Different carbohydrates vary in their ability to raise blood sugar levels based on the chemical structure of the food and their digestibility and absorbability. The scale goes from 0 to 100, with higher values indicating faster and higher blood sugar levels. Although this tool is valuable, it does not consider the amount of carbohydrates consumed, only the number of carbohydrates per serving size. In contrast, glycemic load considers a food item’s glycemic index and total carbohydrate content. It accurately represents how specific foods in specific quantities affect blood sugar levels.</para>
    <para id="para-00015">Nurses should instruct clients to consume foods on the lower end of the glycemic index spectrum because these foods will help them manage their blood glucose properly. Nurses should also advise clients to check the glycemic load before consuming a meal to know how those foods will impact their blood glucose. Pregnant clients with GD also need to be advised on the frequency and consistency of meals. Three main meals and 2 or 3 smaller meals or snacks eaten at the same time each day are recommended to avoid excessive food intake and ensure steady blood glucose levels throughout the day. Rasmussen et al. (2020) suggest carbohydrate intake at breakfast of 30 g maximum (equivalent to two slices of bread or a bowl of cereal), based on limited research that shows elevated blood glucose levels in the morning.</para>

    <title>Chronic Pregnancy Complications: Thyroid Disease</title>
    <para id="para-00021">Thyroid hormones change during pregnancy, especially when the pregnant individual already has a chronic thyroid condition (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases [NIDDK], 2017; Singh &amp; Sandhu, 2023). Long-term thyroid disorders such as <term id="term-00056">hypothyroidism</term> (the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone) or <term id="term-00057">hyperthyroidism</term> (the thyroid gland produces and excretes too much thyroid hormone) require careful management and oversight during pregnancy to ensure proper fetal growth and overall well-being of both the pregnant client and fetus. Proper thyroid hormone levels ensure the baby’s brain and nervous system develop correctly. As previously discussed, during normal pregnancy T4 levels remain unchanged; during hypothyroidism, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00058">T4 levels</term> register as low, and TSH levels elevate as the pituitary gland attempts to trigger the thyroid to release more T4. Sometimes, T4 can remain within normal limits, and only TSH is elevated (NIDDK, 2017; Singh &amp; Sandhu, 2023). Some signs of hypothyroidism include <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00059">exhaustion</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00060">cold intolerance</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00061">muscle cramps</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00062">constipation</term>, and memory or concentration problems.</para>
    <para id="para-00022">The goal of treatment during pregnancy is to maintain maternal hyperthyroidism at the expected upper limits using the lowest effective prescribed dose of medication while avoiding fetal hypothyroidism.

    <title>Infancy</title>
    <para id="para-00029">The endocrine system undergoes extensive development during <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00066">infancy</term>. The hypothalamus and pituitary gland’s primary function encompasses controlling and releasing hormones that regulate growth and metabolism. These two glands are in the brain and mature during infancy to allow for appropriate hormone secretion. Growth hormone encourages growth and development. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00067">Growth hormone</term> is at a high level during infancy and contributes to rapid developmental alterations during the first year of life (Murray &amp; Clayton, 2022). The thyroid gland produces the hormones <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00068">triiodothyronine (T3)</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00069">thyroxine (T4),</term> which are required for cellular proliferation and differentiation, energy balance, cardiovascular physiology, and overall growth and development.</para>
    <para id="para-00030">During the first few weeks of life, infants use hormones acquired from their mothers via the placenta until their thyroid gland takes over hormone production and secretion. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00070">adrenal glands</term> (located above the kidneys) produce <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00071">cortisol</term> and aldosterone.

Insulin and glucose are hormones regulated by the beta cells in the pancreas. Infants remain sensitive to insulin, which allows for glucose stability. As with the other endocrine glands, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00077">pancreas</term> continues its development during infancy, and hormonal regulation and overall control continue to mature throughout infancy.</para>

    <para id="para-00033">Hypoglycemic conditions can develop among infants in the following situations: small for gestational age, sepsis, asphyxia, premature birth, transient hyperinsulinemia, a diabetic mother, intrauterine growth restriction, toxemia, and increased metabolic requirements. The signs and symptoms in a newborn include tremors, irritability, diaphoresis, tachypnea, decreased sucking ability, and high-pitched cry leading to lethargy, hypertonicity, convulsions, and coma.</para>
    <para id="para-00034">When treating hypoglycemia, oral feedings are preferred. However, if the infant is unable to take an oral feeding, or if no improvement occurs after 30 minutes, then 2 mL/kg 10% <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00086">dextrose</term> is given intravenously over 1 min; if the infant has a seizure, 4 mL/kg should be given. Subsequently, glucose is given intravenously at 6–8 mg/kg/min (Kurtoglu et al., 2019). Discontinue intravenous glucose supplementation and resume solely oral feedings after clearance by the pediatrician or neonatologist.</para>

    <title>Childhood</title>
    <para id="para-00037">A child’s growth, health, and development depend on a functioning endocrine system. The hormones act as chemical messengers to control physical functions and physiologic development, including growth, metabolism, sexual development, and other physical functions. As children undergo critical and rapid alterations, the main hormonal signals are sent from the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland. These two endocrine organs stimulate the production and release of specific hormones that target the other endocrine glands.</para>
    <para id="para-00038">A child’s endocrine system goes through many phases as it is stimulated during the growth and development of the thyroid, adrenal glands, pancreas, and gonads (testes in males and ovaries in females). The hormones are necessary for optimal development as the child prepares for <term id="term-00096">puberty</term> (a stage of development in which sexual maturation and reproduction capabilities refine and mature). The pituitary gland produces growth hormone, which plays an integral role in the child’s growth. <term id="term-00097">Insulin-like growth factors (IGF)</term> play a role in mediating growth hormones; both <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00098">growth hormone</term> and IGF are peptide hormones that effect growth, maintain bone mass, and aid in cellular differentiation (Caputo et al., 2021).</para>
    <para id="para-00039">Growth hormone and IGF promote bone and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00099">tissue growth</term>, adequate nutrients, and hormone balance, which all play integral roles in overall growth and development across the lifespan (Caputo et al., 2021). Without IGF, the utilization of nutrients at the cellular and tissue levels would be compromised. Growth hormone and IGF maintain a correlational relationship with insulin secretion, leading the possibility that growth hormone and IGF affect carbohydrate metabolism (Caputo et al., 2021). IGF enhances insulin sensitivity because it prompts glucose uptake.</para>
    <para id="para-00040">Dietary guidelines for this age group recommend plant-based fiber because it incorporates amino acids that impact nutrient metabolism and absorption. Protein (lean meat and dairy products) and amino acids are essential for healthy growth and development because they play an anabolic role similar to that of growth hormone and IGF. The recommendation is 5–20% for children ages 2–3 and 10–30% for older children and adolescents (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2020).</para>
    <section id="sect-00011">
    <title>Impact of Nutrition on the Endocrine System During Childhood</title>
    <para id="para-00041">Children are not immune to endocrine dysfunction. The nurse must recognize that proper balanced nutrition is vital in supporting optimal endocrine function and development in children and across the lifespan. Children require balanced nutrition to support the production and regulation of hormones (Caputo et al., 2021; U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2020). Proteins are the building blocks of neurotransmitters and hormones. Amino acids used to construct proteins stimulate growth hormone and IGF secretion.</para>
    <para id="para-00042">A balanced diet includes a wide selection of nutrient-rich foods. When children do not get the proper nutrition they need, they may be diagnosed with <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00100">failure to thrive</term>, meaning their weight gain is significantly below that of other children of the same age and sex. A mix of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats encourages growth, development, and proper endocrine function (Caputo et al., 2021). The U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends that children consume 2 or 3 servings of vegetables per day, 2 or 3 servings of fruit, 3 servings of dairy products, 4–6 oz of lean proteins per day, and limited sugary, processed, and fried foods. Fruits and vegetables provide many anti-inflammatory and vital vitamins and nutrients for proper endocrine function. Diets high in protein increase growth hormone and IGF secretion levels, ensuring adequate growth (Caputo et al, 2021). Protein comes from lean meats, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy, legumes, and plant-based protein sources such as tofu.</para>
    <para id="para-00043">Healthy fats include avocados, seeds, nuts, and plant-based oils. These fats aid in hormone production and remain a supportive element of brain development.</para>
    <para id="para-00044">Carbohydrates should be mainly whole grains, such as oats, brown rice, whole wheat bread, and quinoa. Refined sugars and processed foods should be avoided. These recommended carbohydrate options allow for slower energy release and limit blood sugar spikes while providing sustained energy. Children need micronutrients such as calcium, vitamin D, iron, zinc, selenium, and iodine for proper endocrine health. These micronutrients are found in a variety of fruits and vegetables. These recommendations are designed for the general population, but clients diagnosed with a medical condition may need a referral to a registered dietitian. The National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements provides recommendations on <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00101">micronutrient intake</term> by age at <link url="https://openstax.org/r/odnihgovfact">https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-all/</link>.</para>

Although such children look over nourished, the opposite is true (Kobylinska et al., 2022). <term id="term-00103">Malnutrition</term> occurs when the body either does not receive sufficient nutrients or is unable to absorb essential nutrients. The individual’s body composition changes, and functions are impaired (Kobylinska et al., 2022). Obesity and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00104">malnutrition</term> share a paradoxical relationship. Although obese children receive an abundance of calories, these calories may lack essential nutrients to promote daily performance, encourage proper growth and development, and encourage overall bodily homeostasis. Moreover, the obese child cannot fully absorb the essential nutrients because of systemic inflammation (Kobylinska et al., 2022).</para>
    <para id="para-00046">Malnutrition in children with obesity may result from poor dietary choices (nutrient-poor foods), sedentary lifestyles, socioeconomic factors (limited access to healthy and wholesome foods), or lack of nutritional education.

Addressing this condition requires the collective efforts of family, caregivers, health care providers, nurses, dietitians, and communities.</para>

    <title>Adolescence</title>
    <para id="para-00048">Many changes occur within the endocrine system during <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00106">adolescence</term>. As <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00107">puberty</term> progresses in adolescence, sexual maturation and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00108">reproduction</term> capabilities refine and mature, these capabilities define puberty (Breehl &amp; Caban, 2023). The primary physiological function of puberty is the production of mature adults capable of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00109">sexual reproduction</term>. Hormonal changes trigger the onset of puberty, which occurs between the ages of 8 and 13 years in girls and 9 and 14 years in boys. The physical changes associated with puberty in girls include breast development, menarche, and growth of pubic and axillary hair. In boys, the changes include genitalia development, voice deepening, increasing height, and growth of pubic hair.</para>
    <para id="para-00049">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00110">endocrine glands</term> involved in puberty include the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, adrenal glands, ovaries, and testes. All of the hormones affect nearly every organ system in the body. For example, in the musculoskeletal system, the muscles grow; the circulatory and respiratory systems see rapid growth. The nervous system is influenced by hormonal changes as well. The increase in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00111">estrogen</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00112">testosterone</term> affects the limbic system through receptor binding, stimulating the sex drive and increasing the emotional roller coaster (Breehl &amp; Caba, 2023).

    <title>Impact of Nutrition on the Endocrine System During Adolescence</title>
    <para id="para-00050">Nutritional recommendations are crucial for adolescents transitioning from childhood into sexual maturity (Soliman et al., 2022). The rapid changes and increasing energy demand for protein and micronutrients remain necessary for growth and development during this stage of life. Food insecurity, obesity, and body dysmorphia prevent this age group from getting the necessary nutrients. Evidence-based data supporting dietary recommendations for adolescents going through puberty are limited (Soliman et al., 2022). The <emphasis effect="italics">Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020–2025</emphasis> recommend 3 servings of vegetables, 2–2½ servings of fruits, 7–10 servings of grains, 3 servings of dairy products, and 5–7 oz of lean protein (such as chicken, poultry, and seafood) per day (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2020). The recommendations also include limiting fried, fatty, and processed foods.</para>
    <para id="para-00051">The nurse should perform a thorough nutritional assessment by asking the adolescent client about their favorite foods, the foods they consume both at home and when they are with their peers, the number of servings of nutrient-dense foods they eat each day, and ways that social media may be influencing their dietary habits. Adolescents who do not consume enough nutrient-rich foods may be at risk for deficiencies of iron, folate, vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, and vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, which might delay their growth and development, as well as puberty.</para>

    <title>Adulthood</title>
    <para id="para-00052">The human body in adulthood continues to rely on the homeostasis, metabolic requirements, development, and reproduction function that the endocrine system provides through the secretion of hormones (Campbell &amp; Jialal, 2022). Physiologic changes continue as adolescents transition into young adults and then into adulthood. These changes include peak physical growth; sexual maturation; brain development; and reproductive, metabolism, and hormonal stability. Women stop growing earlier than men do, between 20 and 35 years of age, whereas men continue to grow into adulthood and reach peak physical strength and stamina between 30 and 40 years of age.</para>
    <para id="para-00053">Adults also reach <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00113">sexual maturation</term>. Sexual maturation and reproductive system markers include regular menstrual cycles for females and peak testosterone production for males. Secondary sexual characteristics such as breast development in women and facial hair growth in males reach full development. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00114">Growth hormone</term> continues to play a role in adulthood, as male skeletal growth is typically completed during this stage of life. Growth hormone contributes to muscle growth, repair, and maintenance. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00115">Thyroid hormones</term>, including T4 and T3, play a role in metabolism, heart function, and energy regulation. Insulin regulates blood glucose levels; during adulthood, nondiabetic adults respond effectively to the insulin their bodies produce, allowing them to fully use the carbohydrates consumed and aid in the metabolism process.</para>
    <para id="para-00054">As in all stages of life, the body continuously attempts to achieve homeostasis. This hormonal balance is crucial for overall health, reproductive function, mood regulation, and metabolism. Hormonal changes vary based on individuals’ genetics, lifestyle, and overall health. Nutrition integrates within the system to help it reach homeostasis.</para>
    <para id="para-00055">Nutrition plays a pivotal role in the health of adults for optimal endocrine function and prevention of endocrine dysfunction (Caputo et al., 2021). The role of healthy nutrients includes overall health and endocrine disorder prevention; energy-based performance; weight management; bone, mental health, and cognitive function; healthy aging; and disease management and healing. A balanced diet includes whole grains, lean protein, fruits, vegetables, healthy fats, and water. Micronutrient foods include antioxidant-rich foods that decrease inflammation and the inflammatory process, containing vitamins A, C, D, zinc, iodine, selenium, iron, and magnesium. Foods that contain these important micronutrients include leafy green vegetables, citrus fruits, berries, nuts, seeds, lean meats, fatty fish, dairy, and whole grains. The nurse should advise individuals to avoid processed and refined sugary foods and beverages to encourage optimal endocrine function. Heavily processed foods contribute to inflammation, insulin resistance, and hormonal imbalances.</para>

    <title>Later Adulthood</title>
    <para id="para-00056">Age-related changes affect every endocrine organ (van den Beld et al., 2018). As the function of the organ system begins to decline with age, other factors, such as inflammation and caloric intake, play a role in endocrine function. A study by van den Beld et al. (2018) found that regular <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00116">aging</term> changes were associated with an increase in the concentration <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00117">of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)</term>; but alterations in TSH concentration remained dependent on iodine status. T3 blood concentrations fluctuate depending on the individual. The overall decline in thyroid home activity resulted from hormone metabolism changes, inflammation, and energy restriction. Further research is needed to develop age-specific hormone reference ranges to guide health care providers in hormone replacement therapy (van den Beld et al., 2018).</para>
    <para id="para-00057">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00118">hypothalamic–pituitary–somatotropic</term> axis remains responsible for growth hormone secretion into the blood from the pituitary gland (van den Beld et al., 2018). Average age-related growth hormone secretion decline is called <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00119">somatopause</term>. Somatopause is associated with adipose tissue increase and leads to the decline of growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor after puberty.</para>
    <para id="para-00058"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00120">Undernutrition</term> occurs as normal aging brings appetite suppression and limited food intake (Molfino et al., 2021; van den Beld et al., 2018). The endocrine system plays a role in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00121">appetite suppression</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00122">anorexia</term>. Hormonal changes include increases in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00123">cholecystokinin</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00124">leptin</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00125">cytokines</term> and a decrease in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00126">ghrelin</term>. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00127">Appetite suppression</term> in older adults revolves around the increase in levels of cholecystokinin. Nurses and health care providers combat cholecystokinin with an antagonist to stimulate the appetite and increase nutritional consumption. Frail older adults can experience diminished leptin levels, while healthy older people can have increased concentration levels of circulating leptin (van den Beld et al., 2018). Aging is also associated with glucose intolerance, elevated insulin levels, and vitamin and mineral deficiencies.</para>
    <para id="para-00059">For older adults, consuming enough protein to minimize age-associated loss in muscle mass is important. The recommendation for protein intake includes 23–31 oz per week at the minimum or 35% of total calories (Molfino et al., 2021; U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2020). Continuous anorexia in frail older adults negatively impacts their body composition; to combat this problem early nutritional intervention improves outcomes and quality of life (Molfino et al., 2021). Like all age groups, older adults should strive to choose nutrient rich foods. The ability to absorb <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00128">Vitamin B<sub>12</sub></term> decreases with age and the use of certain medications, so ensuring adequate intake of this vitamin is of particular concern (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2020).</para>
