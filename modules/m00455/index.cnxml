    <para id="para-00001">Transgender and nonbinary health care encompasses many aspects. This chapter begins by listing and defining some of the preferred terms used to refer to transgender and nonbinary individuals. An important issue for nurses and other health care professionals to remember is that each transgender or nonbinary individual may have their own preferred words. Therefore, an important first step in caring for these clients is finding out what those words are.</para>
    <para id="para-00002">This chapter then introduces the medications used to enhance or modify sexual characteristics including nursing implications and client education. Some of the medications in this chapter are also covered in <link document="m00448">Reproductive Health Drugs</link>, but this chapter focuses on their use for adjusting sexual characteristics.</para>
