<para id="para-00002">Most medical conditions can be attributed to a breakdown in the homeostatic control system, whether it is due to an inability to detect external changes, failure to initiate a feedback loop, inability to respond to or return to the set point, or failure in the set point itself. The primary objective of health care providers is to restore the body’s homeostasis to prevent cellular death and irreversible organ damage.</para>

<title>Maintaining Homeostasis</title>
<para id="para-00003">The human body maintains a state of internal balance, called <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">homeostasis</term>, which is regulated at the cellular level. Even when the external environment fluctuates, the body strives to keep this balance within a narrow range. However, a temporary transient change can occur before the body returns to a steady state. Changes in the extracellular or intracellular fluid compartments can occur due to internal or external factors and are crucial for maintaining a narrow range to prevent cell death, tissue damage, and organ dysfunction (Libretti &amp; Puckett, 2022).</para>

<title>Factors Impacting Homeostasis</title>
<para id="para-00004">Disturbances in physiologic factors can have a significant impact on the body’s ability to maintain homeostasis. Such disturbances include the following:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00002">
<item>Disruptions in energy and nutrient balance, such as those that cause fluctuations in glucose levels</item>
<item>Dysregulation of immune response modulators, such as pH and cortisol</item>
<item>Disturbances in fluid and electrolyte levels, particularly sodium, potassium, and calcium</item>
</list>
<para id="para-00005">These components play a critical role in maintaining homeostasis and are governed by a complex <term id="term-00002">homeostatic mechanism</term> called a feedback loop, which is discussed in more depth in a later section of this chapter.</para>

<section id="sect-00004">
<title>Osmotic Equilibrium</title>
<para id="para-00006"><term id="term-00003">Osmotic equilibrium</term> occurs when the concentration of solutes on either side of a <term id="term-00004">semipermeable membrane</term> is equalized. It is achieved when the osmotic pressure of a solution is equal to the <term id="term-00005">hydrostatic pressure</term> on the solution. The force that causes the reabsorption of fluid from the interstitial fluid into the capillaries is known as osmotic pressure or oncotic pressure. Unlike hydrostatic pressure, which pushes fluid out of the capillaries, osmotic pressure pulls fluid back into them. This balance ensures that the optimal concentrations of electrolytes and nonelectrolytes are maintained in cells, body tissues, and interstitial fluid. Transient changes in the body, such as changes in temperature or pH, can disrupt the osmotic equilibrium, leading to a shift of water and solutes between intracellular and extracellular fluid compartments in an attempt to restore balance.</para>
<para id="para-00007">The <term id="term-00006">Na<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>ATPase pump</term> is an essential component in maintaining osmotic equilibrium (Pirahanchi et al., 2022). This pump moves sodium ions out of the cell and potassium ions into the cell, against their concentration gradients. This active transport process requires energy from <term id="term-00007">adenosine 5-triphosphate (ATP)</term>, an energy molecule (Hoorm et al., 2020).Osmotic equilibrium is essential for maintaining proper functioning of cells and body tissues. <link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00234"/> illustrates the Na<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>ATPase pumpand the method by which it allows for osmotic equilibrium.</para>
