<para id="para-00002"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">Uterine motility drugs</term> are used during labor to stimulate contractions (<term id="term-00002">oxytocics</term>) or to induce abortion (<term id="term-00003">abortifacients</term>). Other medications (<term id="term-00004">tocolytics</term>), such as terbutaline, are used to delay contraction in the event of premature labor.</para>
<para id="para-00003"><term id="term-00005">Lactation</term> is the secretion of milk by the mammary glands. Some medications can pass from the milk to the infant. Thus, when the lactating client must take medications, consideration must be given to the possible harmful effects on the infant. Because this content is highly specialized and used only in maternal health, this section will cover only basic information.</para>
<section id="sect-00003">
<title>Uterine Motility Drugs</title>
<para id="para-00004">Uterine motility drugs affect the movement (contractions) of the uterus. Motility drugs may either increase or decrease uterine contractions, depending on the client’s specific situation. Fetal distress, abnormal fetal presentation, fetal demise, and maternal hemorrhage might be reasons to increase uterine contractions and facilitate delivery. On the other hand, premature labor may be a reason to slow uterine contractions. Generally, these medications are administered in an acute-care setting with monitoring equipment available.</para>
<section id="sect-00004">
<title>Oxytocics</title>
<para id="para-00005">Oxytocics are used to induce and increase uterine contractions during labor. The two drugs in this category are methylergonovine and oxytocin. These drugs are administered in labor and delivery or postpartum units in a medical facility where the client can be monitored closely.</para>
<para id="para-00006">Methylergonovine is administered IM or via IV immediately after delivery and then orally for up to 1 week as needed. Methylergonovine works directly on the uterine smooth muscle to prevent postpartum hemorrhage. It also helps with uterine involution, the process whereby the uterus gradually resumes its prepartum size and weight. The IM dose is 1 mL (0.2 mg) after delivery of the anterior shoulder, after delivery of the placenta, or during the puerperium (several weeks after childbirth). Dosage may be repeated as required at intervals of 2–4 hours. The IV dose is 1 mL (0.2 mg) administered slowly over a period of no less than 60 seconds (DailyMed, <emphasis effect="italics">Methylergonovine,</emphasis> 2020).</para>
<para id="para-00007">Oxytocin is administered by intravenous infusion starting at 1–2 mU/minute and gradually increased in increments of no more than 1–2 mU/minute until a normal labor contraction pattern is established. Oxytocin works by exerting a selective action on the smooth musculature of the uterus, which stimulates rhythmic contractions of the uterus, increases the frequency of existing contractions, and improves muscle tone of the uterus. It can be used to facilitate labor contractions as well as to prevent postpartum hemorrhage.</para>

<title>Adverse Effects and Contraindications</title>
<para id="para-00009">Methylergonovine is contraindicated or used cautiously in clients who have coronary artery disease, diabetes, or hypercholesterolemia because it may increase the risk for more serious side effects. Kidney and liver disease are also conditions that may require caution when using methylergonovine because of delayed metabolism and excretion of the drug. Pregnancy, hypertension, and toxemia are contraindications for the drug. One notable drug–food interaction is grapefruit and grapefruit juice (DailyMed, <emphasis effect="italics">Methylergonovine</emphasis>, 2020).</para>
<para id="para-00010">Side effects include worsening of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, abdominal pain, headache, and increased blood pressure. Other less-common side effects include chest pain or discomfort; difficult or labored breathing; dizziness; pounding or irregular heartbeat; pain or discomfort in the arms, jaw, back, or neck; and puffiness around the eyes, face, lips, or tongue (DailyMed,<emphasis effect="italics"> Methylergonovine</emphasis>, 2020).</para>
<para id="para-00011">Oxytocin is contraindicated in hypersensitivity, obstetric emergencies that negatively affect either the birthing parent or fetus, during fetal distress, when vaginal delivery is inadvisable or fetal positions/presentations are not favorable for delivery, and in uterine contraction pattern dysfunction.</para>
<para id="para-00012">The maternal side effects of oxytocin include nausea, vomiting, cardiac dysrhythmias, uterine hypertonicity, uterine rupture, postpartum hemorrhage, pelvic hematoma, water intoxication, and dilutional hyponatremia. Side effects for the fetus include bradycardia and other cardiac dysrhythmias, impaired fetal oxygenation, permanent brain or central nervous system (CNS) damage, and retinal hemorrhage.</para>

<title>Tocolytics</title>
<para id="para-00014">Tocolytics are drugs used to delay contractions to prevent premature labor and the associated risks, including death of the infant. Magnesium sulfate (MgSO<sub>4</sub>) is the drug used for this purpose. The indications for a tocolytic drug are premature labor after 20 weeks’ gestation and generally prior to the 34th week. The purpose of using a tocolytic is to delay labor long enough (24 hours–7 days) to administer corticosteroids to the birthing parent. This allows for fetal lung development to progress to a point where the fetus has enough surfactant to prevent respiratory distress after delivery.</para>
<para id="para-00015">MgSO<sub>4</sub> acts as a CNS and muscular depressant by preventing the peripheral neuromuscular transmission of acetylcholine. Also, MgSO<sub>4</sub> is a calcium antagonist, thus blocking calcium from entering cells and causing muscle contractions.</para>
<para id="para-00016">As a tocolytic agent, MgSO<sub>4</sub> use is controversial. Its primary use is controlling the seizures of preeclampsia or eclampsia in the birthing parent. It can possibly slow uterine contractions long enough to administer corticosteroids to the birthing parent, but current research does not support this belief. MgSO<sub>4</sub> is a drug that can cause sudden and severe adverse effects, and the client must be monitored closely. Any change in mental status such as decreased level of consciousness or confusion, sudden drop in blood pressure, loss of patellar reflex, depressed respirations, or hypermagnesemia should be treated immediately to prevent complete cardiovascular collapse and death. The treatment for magnesium toxicity is intravenous calcium gluconate or calcium chloride.</para>
<para id="para-00017">MgSO<sub>4</sub> can also be significantly detrimental to the fetus. It can cause hypocalcemia, skeletal demineralization, osteopenia, and bone and skeletal abnormalities if used more than 5–7 days during fetal development. The infusion during labor can lead to heart rate changes, hypotonia, respiratory depression, and possibly death.</para>

<title>Abortifacients</title>
<para id="para-00019">Abortifacients are medications used to evacuate the uterus via powerful contractions. These contractions empty the uterus of implanted <term id="term-00011">trophoblasts</term>, the cells that become the placenta, and prevent any fertilized egg from being implanted. Abortifacients are used during weeks 12–20 to terminate a pregnancy or to expel the fetus in cases of fetal demise. Carboprost and mifepristone are the drugs in this category.</para>
<para id="para-00020">The topic of abortion is highly controversial in the United States. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned the <emphasis effect="italics">Roe v. Wade</emphasis> precedent in 2022. Thus, each U.S. state now writes and enacts its own legislation regarding abortion. In some states, health care professionals can be criminally charged for various actions related to abortions. Because nurses may be in situations that could involve some aspect of abortion, they should be cognizant of the abortion laws in the state where they practice. Each state’s nurses’ association and board of nursing, as well as the American Nurses Association, are resources nurses can contact for any questions or concerns about abortion laws.

<title>Drugs During Pregnancy and Lactation</title>
<para id="para-00030">Drug therapy must be approached cautiously during pregnancy, as some medications may have serious effects for the pregnant client or the fetus. Medications can be passed to the fetus through the placental membrane. Some medications are <term id="term-00017">teratogenic</term>, meaning they can cause serious birth defects, especially if given within the first trimester. The most critical period for fetal development is from conception to day 58–60 when major fetal organs form. Although some medications can pose risks of harm to the fetus, some maternal conditions such as pregnancy-induced hypertension or gestational diabetes may also cause harm. The situation must be viewed from a perspective of risks versus benefits to the birthing parent and fetus/infant. The emphasis for medications that treat a maternal condition is on choosing the safest drug from a class and monitoring the client more closely. In this way, the risks can be mitigated, even if not eliminated.</para>
<para id="para-00031">After delivery, special precautions are still needed for clients who are <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">breastfeeding</term>, as some medications can be transferred to the infant through breast milk. The National Library of Medicine (NLM) maintains the <link url="https://openstax.org/r/ncbinlmnihgov"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00019">LactMed® database</term></link> of drug information on relevant medications that clients who are breastfeeding may be exposed to (National Library of Medicine, n.d.). When assessing clients, nurses should determine if clients are breastfeeding and review the clients’ medications for any potential concerns. Nurses should instruct clients to contact their health care provider first before taking any medication while breastfeeding to reduce the risk of adverse effects on the child.</para>
