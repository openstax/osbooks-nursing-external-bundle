        <title>Immunosuppressant Drugs</title>
        <para id="para-00003">Immunosuppressant is a class of medicines that inhibit or decrease the intensity of the immune response in the body. (Hussain &amp; Khan, 2022). They are commonly prescribed to clients who have received an organ transplant and those with <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">autoimmune disorders</term> such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. While these medications can effectively prevent rejection of transplanted organs and manage symptoms of autoimmune diseases, they also come with potential adverse effects. Clients taking immunosuppressants may be at higher risk for infections, including opportunistic infections that can be life-threatening.</para>
        <para id="para-00004">It is important for clients who are taking immunosuppressant drugs to work closely with their health care provider to monitor any potential side effects and receive regular follow-ups. Additionally, steps should be taken to minimize the risk of infection, such as practicing good hygiene and avoiding close contact with sick clients. Overall, while immunosuppressant drugs can be beneficial in certain medical conditions, it is important for clients to weigh the potential benefits against the risks and work closely with their health care provider to ensure safe and effective use.</para>

        <title>Glucocorticoids</title>
        <para id="para-00005"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">Glucocorticoids</term> are a steroid hormone produced by the kidneys’ adrenal cortexes that regulate metabolism and the immune system. They have anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects, making them essential in treating inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. Commonly used synthetic glucocorticoids include prednisone and dexamethasone. Glucocorticoids are typically reserved for short-term or last-resort use due to potential toxic effects. Careful tapering is necessary to address potential rebound symptoms resulting from prolonged use (see <link target-id="table-00001" document="m00242"/> for dosing information and <link document="m00403">Adrenal, Pituitary, and Hypothalamus Disorder Drugs</link> for additional information on glucocorticoids).</para>

        <para id="para-00006"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">Azathioprine</term> is an immunosuppressant used to treat autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Azathioprine works by suppressing the immune system, reducing inflammation, and preventing tissue damage. Long-term use has been associated with an increased risk of certain types of cancer. Regular blood tests, such as a complete blood cell count to detect bone marrow suppression or infection, liver function tests to ensure no abnormal liver function is occurring, and serum creatinine to assess proper kidney function, may also be necessary to ensure that the medication is not causing any adverse or harmful effects on the body.

They are used to treat various medical conditions, particularly autoimmune rheumatic diseases, and certain types of cancer (American Cancer Society, 2018; Drosos et al., 2021). Biologics are different from traditional chemical-based drugs because of their complex structure and the process used to manufacture them, which involves biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques.</para>
        <para id="para-00018"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">Monoclonal antibodies</term> are a type of biologic drug. They are engineered in the laboratory to target and bind to specific molecules or cells in the body, thus exerting precise and targeted effects (American Cancer Society, 2018.). Monoclonal antibodies are designed to mimic the immune system’s natural ability to recognize and attack foreign invaders, such as bacteria, viruses, and cancer cells. These antibodies can be used to block certain pathways involved in disease processes, modulate immune responses, or deliver drugs directly to specific cells or tissues.</para>
        <para id="para-00019">Both biologic drugs and monoclonal antibodies have revolutionized the treatment of various medical conditions, providing more personalized and effective therapeutic options for clients with complex and difficult-to-treat diseases. However, due to their complex manufacturing process and targeted actions, these medications can be relatively expensive compared to traditional drugs. Additionally, some clients may experience immune-related side effects, and close monitoring is often required during treatment.</para>

        <title>Biosimilar Drugs</title>
        <para id="para-00030">Biosimilar drugs are a type of biologic medication that is highly similar to an already approved reference biologic, also known as the original biologic or reference product. Biosimilars are designed to have similar efficacy, safety, and quality as the reference product (American Cancer Society, 2018; U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2023). They are developed to be equivalent in terms of structure, biological activity, and clinical effects.</para>
        <para id="para-00031">Unlike generic versions of traditional chemical-based drugs, which are identical to their reference products, biosimilars are not exact copies due to the complexity of biologics and the variability in the manufacturing process. Biosimilars undergo rigorous testing and comparison to the reference product to ensure they are highly similar and have no clinically meaningful differences in terms of safety and efficacy.</para>
        <para id="para-00032">Biosimilars offer an opportunity to increase access to effective biologic treatments at potentially lower costs compared to the reference products. They play a crucial role in promoting competition and driving down prices, making biologic therapies more affordable for clients and health care systems.</para>
        <para id="para-00033">Regulatory authorities, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have established robust guidelines for the approval of biosimilars, ensuring they meet stringent standards for quality, safety, and efficacy (American Cancer Society, 2018). This regulatory framework ensures that clients can have confidence in the safety and effectiveness of biosimilar medications.</para>

        <para id="para-00034">Pegfilgrastim is a medication used to reduce the risk of infection in clients undergoing certain cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy, that may cause a decrease in the body's white blood cell count.
